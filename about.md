---

My name Tis_awesomeness, but you can call me **Tis**. You may see me occasionally in the technical Minecraft and Discord developer communities. I'm a fan of open source everything, so all my projects are open source if possible.

I'm a developer and college student from North Carolina, and an [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) alumni! I particularly like working with robot computer vision.

# Advent of Code

I completed [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for 2017, 2020, and 2021. Check out my [stats](/advent).
