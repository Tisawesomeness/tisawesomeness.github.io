## Acceptable Use

- Interferes with the normal functionality of the Gaia bot or an external service, such as a Hytale server

We reserve the right to take any appropriate measure to protect the availability and usability of the bot, including denying users access to the bot.

## Third-Party Content

Several bot commands link to third-party content such as Hytale skins or Hytale server listings. The bot has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for any third-party content.

## Disclaimers

Gaia is provided as-is. There are no guarantees that it will be available in the future, and its purpose or availability may be changed at any time.
