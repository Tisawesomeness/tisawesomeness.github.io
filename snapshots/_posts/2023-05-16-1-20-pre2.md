Another pre-release, another ancient bug fixed.

## Death Messages

Added a new death message for dying to `/kill` while fighting a mob or player:

> `<player>` was killed whilst fighting `<attacker>`

## Enchanting

To fix [MC-261816](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-261816), the following blocks were removed from `#replaceable` and now block enchanting:

- Sunflower
- Lilac
- Rose Bush
- Peony

## Sniffer

Tempted baby sniffers now follow the player from 2.5 blocks away, rather than 3.5 blocks, fixing [MC-262441](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-262441).

## Boat Dispensing

Boats are now dispensed such that the bottom of the boat is one pixel (1/16, or 0.0625 blocks) below the water surface. If the dispenser is facing horizontal, then the side of the boat is one pixel away from the dispenser, fixing [MC-1310](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-1310).

## Misc

The following non-breaking space characters now count as whitespace in anvil item renames (to fix [MC-262181](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-262181)), the `SkullOwner` NBT tag, and the quickplay launcher args.

- `U+00A0` No-Break Space
- `U+2007` Figure Space
- `U+202F` Narrow No-Break Space

Strings containing only whitespace will be rejected.
