The first 1.21.6 release candidate is out. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-6-release-candidate-1).

## Happy Ghast

Passengers now ride 1.7 blocks away from the middle of the Happy Ghast instead of 1.8 blocks away, fixing [MC-298633](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-298633).
