A much smaller snapshot with mostly bugfixes.

## Slime Blocks

Crouching while falling on a slime block now causes the player to land on the slime block without bouncing or taking fall damage, fixing [MC-54532](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-54532).

Jumping while falling on a slime block no longer cancels the bounce effect, players will get the full bounce. According to the comment in [MC-275834](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-275834), this is intentional.

## Projectiles

Arrows and tridents now check for collisions after applying gravity and inertia. This may affect sensitive contraptions using projectile motion.

Tridents thrown by drowned (or owned by non-player entities) now despawn if the trident is within one block plus the entity's hitbox width of the entity's eye position. For drowned, the trident must be within 1.6 blocks of the drowned's eyes. Fixes [MC-276072](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-276072).
