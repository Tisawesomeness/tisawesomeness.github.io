The first snapshot for 1.19.4 is out!.

# Mobs

Items without durability (such as a fire charge) are now used up properly when used to ignite a creeper.

Mob heads can only be placed on noteblocks without sneaking when the 1.20 experimental datapack is enabled.

# Commands

Commands that take IP addresses as arguments (such as `/banip`) now support IPv6 addresses such as `2001:db8::1`.

# Accessibility

The onboarding screen does not show when upgrading an existing Minecraft installation to a newer version.

The narrator now reads server ping, version, MOTD, and player count in the multiplayer server list. If a LAN server is found, the narrator will announce it.

The narrator now says the number of online players when opening the player list with tab.

# Misc

Players can no longer change dimensions while sleeping, fixing [MC-258173](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-258173).

# Tags

Added `#noteblock_top_instruments` biome tag to the 1.20 experimental datapack, which controls which blocks can be placed on top of noteblocks without sneaking.

The `#increased_fire_burnout` tag now controls which biomes extinguish fire quicker. The list of biomes is:

```
bamboo_jungle
mushroom_fields
mangrove_swamp
snowy_slopes
frozen_peaks
jagged_peaks
swamp
jungle
```

`swamp` and `mangrove_swamp` were added, and `sparse_jungle` was removed.

# Packets

Packet bundles can contain up to 4096 packets.
