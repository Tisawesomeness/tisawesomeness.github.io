The first snapshot for 1.18 is out! It is an experimental snapshot, you must download it from the [changelog]().

# Experimental Snapshots

I will cover experimental 1.18 snapshots if they have significant changes beyond world generation tweaks. Keep in mind that new features may be changed or removed at any time.

Experimental snapshots must be downloaded from the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/new-world-generation-java-available-testing).

To decompile the snapshot with DecompilerMC:

1. Download and unzip the snapshot from the changelog
2. Enter the folder you just unzipped and rename the json file to `version.json`
3. Place the folder into the `DecompilerMC/versions` (where DecompilerMC is the location of your DecompilerMC files)
4. Run `python main.py -mcv experimental -s`, replace `experimental` with the name of the folder you extracted
