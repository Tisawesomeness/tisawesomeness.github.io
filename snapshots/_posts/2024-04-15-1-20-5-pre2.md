Another pre-release with many bugfixes. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-20-5-pre-release-2).

## Mobs

The `generic.scale` attribute now has no effect on the Ender Dragon, fixing [MC-267414](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-267414).

Foxes now have a `generic.safe_fall_distance` attribute of 5.

Horses now have a `generic.safe_fall_distance` attribute of 6, and a `generic.fall_damage_multiplier` attribute of 0.5.

## Data Packs

The `table_bonus` loot item condition now requires at least one item in the `chances` list, fixing [MC-269472](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-269472).

## Network Protocol

The client will only try to disconnect if an exception occurs while handling the packet. Clients will not disconnect if sent an unrecognized custom packet.
