21w44a is out now, adding optimizations and the ability to opt-out of player listings. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-21w44a).

# Animal Spawning Tags

New block tags have been added to customize which blocks animals are allowed to spawn on. They are:
- `#animals_spawnable_on`: Grass Block
- `#axolotls_spawnable_on`: Clay
- `#foxes_spawnable_on`: Grass Block, Snow, Snow Block, Podzol, Coarse Dirt
- `#goats_spawnable_on`: Stone, Snow, Powder Snow, Snow Block, Packed Ice, Gravel
- `#mooshrooms_spawnable_on`: Mycelium
- `#parrots_spawnable_on`: Grass Block, Air, `#leaves`, `#logs`
- `#polar_bears_spawnable_on_in_frozen_ocean`: Ice
- `#rabbits_spawnable_on`: Grass Block, Snow, Snow Block, Sand
- `#wolves_spawnable_on`: Grass Block, Snow, Snow Block

# Optional Player Listing

Players who opt-out of displaying their name in server listings can still appear in the server listing, but with "Anonymous Player" as the username and 0 as the UUID. The server does not try to avoid randomly selecting anonymous players.
