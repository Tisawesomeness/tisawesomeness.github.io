Ender pearls now chunkload. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w37a).

## Ender Pearls

Ender pearls create a chunkloading ticket when they enter a new chunk and every 2 seconds when the pearl stays in the same chunk. The ticket loads a single entity-ticking chunk, a 3x3 square of redstone processing chunks (also known as block-ticking chunks), and a 5x5 square of lazy chunks (also known as border chunks). The chunkloading ticket times out after 2 seconds.

## Breeze

No longer need to be facing players to shoot at them, fixing [MC-275538](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-275538).

## Mob Conversions

Some properties mentioned in [MC-88967](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-88967) and not mentioned in the changelog are not transferred in any conversion:
- `AngerTime` and `AngryAt`
	- No mob that can be converted has this tag, as Piglins use `Brain.memories.minecraft:angry_at` instead
	- If this tag is added through commands to a mob that can be converted, it will be deleted after conversion
- `CanBreakDoors` due to [MC-276611](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-276611)
- `Fire` due to [MC-276612](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-276612)
- `RootVehicle`
	- This tag is only used on Players, who can't convert
	- Mobs will keep riding in a vehicle after conversion regardless
	- If this tag is added through commands to a mob that can be converted, it will be deleted after conversion

Some properties mentioned in the changelog continue to only be transferred in some conversions but not others, see the [24w36a post](/snapshots/24w36a) for details:
- `ArmorDropChances`, `ArmorItems`, `HandDropChances`, and `HandItems`
- `CanPickUpLoot`
- `PersistenceRequired`

## TNT Minecarts

The `explosion_power` tag is the base power (usually 4) of the explosion. The game adds a random bonus based on velocity to the base to get the final explosion power. This change fixes [MC-276263](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-276263).
