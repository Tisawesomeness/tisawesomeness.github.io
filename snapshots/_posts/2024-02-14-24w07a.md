This snapshot adds a highly-requested skeleton variant and fixes hoppers.

## Bogged

The bogged has the same loot as a [Stray](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Stray#Drops), except arrows of poison replace arrows of slowness.

Bogged attack every 3.5 seconds on easy or normal difficulty, and every 2.5 seconds on hard difficulty.

Bogged spawn with weight 50 out of 616. Bogged spawn in addition to skeletons, not replacing them. Unlike Strays, Bogged do not require sky light to spawn.

## Breeze

The chances of getting a specific number of wind charges from the Breeze is shown in the table below:

| Count       | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | Average |
| ----------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| Default     | 1/3  | 1/3  | 1/3  |      |      |      | 5       |
| Looting I   | 1/6  | 2/6  | 2/6  | 1/6  |      |      | 5.5     |
| Looting II  | 1/9  | 2/9  | 3/9  | 2/9  | 1/9  |      | 6       |
| Looting III | 1/12 | 2/12 | 3/12 | 3/12 | 2/12 | 1/12 | 6.5     |

## Wind Charge

Wind charges now only collide with blocks whose collision box is a full block. This is likely a [bug](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-268556).

## Hopper

Hopper minecarts have reverted completely to their old behavior. Hopper minecarts now pull items regardless of the block above.
