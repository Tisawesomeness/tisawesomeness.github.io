A few more bugfixes before the 1.20.2 release.

## Server Icons

Clients now only show server icons up to 1024x1024 in size. Clients verify that the icon has a valid [PNG file signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG#File_header) and [IHDR chunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG#Critical_chunks) [type and length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG#%22Chunks%22_within_the_file).
