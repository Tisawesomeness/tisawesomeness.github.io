A smaller snapshot this time, featuring custom equipment and bugfixes. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w36a).

## Entities

A TNT minecart now only explode if it is moving horizontally at 0.1 blocks/tick or faster, meaning minecarts will not explode if they are completely stopped by a block. Fixes [MC-275622](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-275622)

Moving entities now only check up to the first **16 blocks** along the movement path for collisions, fixing [MC-275437](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-275437).

## Mob Conversions

Here is a full list of tags, data, and other properties which get transferred when a mob is converted (only relevant for mobs that can have these properties):
- `AbsorptionAmount`
- `active_effects`
- `Age`
- `Brain.memories.minecraft:angry_at.ttl`
- `Brain.memories.minecraft:angry_at.value`
- `CustomNameVisible`
- `CustomName`
- `fall_distance`
- `FallFlying`
- `ForcedAge`
- `HurtByTimestamp`
- `HurtTime`
- `Invulnerable`
- `IsBaby`
- `Leash`
- `LeftHanded`
- `Motion`
- `NoAI`
- `NoGravity`
- `OnGround`
- `Passengers`
- `PortalCooldown`
- `Position`
- `RootVehicle` (refers to the vehicle the entity rides, not an actual tag saved on mobs)
- `Rotation`
- `Silent`
- `SleepingX`
- `SleepingY`
- `SleepingZ`
- `Tags`
- `Team`

Mobs that split into several mobs rather than converting from one type into another do not transfer the following properties:
- `ArmorDropChances`
- `ArmorItems`
- `fall_distance`
- `FallFlying`
- `HandDropChances`
- `HandItems`
- `HurtByTimestamp`
- `HurtTime`
- `Leash`
- `Motion`
- `OnGround`
- `Passengers`
- `Position`
- `Rotation`
- `SleepingX`
- `SleepingY`
- `SleepingZ`

Some properties mentioned in [MC-88967](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-88967) are not transferred in any conversion:
- `AngerTime` and `AngryAt`
	- No mob that can be converted has this tag, as Piglins use `Brain.memories.minecraft:angry_at` instead
	- If this tag is added through commands to a mob that can be converted, it will be deleted after conversion
- `CanBreakDoors` due to [MC-276611](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-276611)
- `Fire` due to [MC-276612](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-276612)
- `Gossips`
- `UUID`
- `VillagerData`
- `Xp`

Despite the fix in [MC-270842](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-270842), scoreboard objectives are not transferred.

Some properties mentioned in [MC-88967](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-88967) are transferred in some conversions but not others:
- `ArmorDropChances`, `ArmorItems`, `HandDropChances`, and `HandItems` (referred to as "Equipment" in the below chart)
- `CanPickUpLoot`
- `PersistenceRequired`

| Husk            | Zombie           | Kept      | Kept            | Kept                  |
| Zombie          | Drowned          | Kept      | Kept            | Kept                  |

\* Pigs cannot spawn with `CanPickUpLoot`, so all zombified piglins converted from pigs cannot pick up loot

\*\* Hoglins cannot wear equipment without commands
