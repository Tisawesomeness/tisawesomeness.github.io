A smaller snapshot this time, featuring custom equipment and bugfixes. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w36a).

## Entities

A TNT minecart now only explode if it is moving horizontally at 0.1 blocks/tick or faster, meaning minecarts will not explode if they are completely stopped by a block. Fixes [MC-275622](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-275622)

Moving entities now only check up to the first **16 blocks** along the movement path for collisions, fixing [MC-275437](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-275437).

## Mob Conversions

When a mob converts from one type to another (ex: Piglin to Zombified Piglin), the following data is copied from the old mob to the new mob:
- Attributes
- Sleeping position
- Yaw rotation
- Velocity
- Fall distance
- Whether the entity is touching the ground (`OnGround`)
- Whether the entity is gliding as if using an elytra (`FallFlying`)
- Passengers
- Leash
- Invulnerability ticks after being hit (`HurtTime`)
- 100-tick cooldown set when player damages the mob, used to determine if the mob's death should count as a player kill (not written to NBT)

When either a mob converts from one type to another, or a slime or magma cube splits into multiple mobs, the following data is copied from the old mob to the new mob(s):
- Age (`Age`, `ForcedAge`, and `IsBaby`)
- Absorption
- Status effects
- Portal cooldown
- Piglin anger target (`ANGRY_AT` memory)
- Left-handedness
- Custom name (`CustomName` and `CustomNameVisible`)
- `NoAI`
- `NoGravity`
- `Invulnerable`
- `Silent`
- `LootTable`
- Tags
- Scoreboard team

\* Pigs cannot spawn with `CanPickUpLoot`, so all zombified piglins convert from pigs cannot pick up loot

\*\* Hoglins cannot wear equipment without commands

The following data is **not** kept when a mob converts into another mob, or a slime or magma cube splits into multiple mobs:
- UUID
- Scoreboard objectives, despite the fix in [MC-270842](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-270842)
- Ticks on fire (`Fire`)
- Ability to break doors (`CanBreakDoors`)

These changes are meant to fix [MC-88967](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-88967).
