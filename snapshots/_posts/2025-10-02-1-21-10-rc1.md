A hotfix release candidate with changes to bubble column mechanics.

## Bubble Columns

Entities are now only pushed by bubble columns if they are moving more than `1 - 1e-5` blocks per tick, or the entity hitbox shrunk by `1e-5` in all directions intersects the bubble column block. All throwable projectiles interact with all intersecting bubble columns on their first tick regardless of these conditions.
