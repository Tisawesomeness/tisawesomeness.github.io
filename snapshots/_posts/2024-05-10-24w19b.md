This snapshot improves chunk loading performance and fixes many, many bugs. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w19a).

## Entities

When a baby mob is about to grow into an adult, the game tries to reposition the mob so the adult will fit. In previous versions, if there is no position where the adult will fit, the mob will grow up at its current position. Now, if there is no position where the adult will fit, the game will try to move the mob so the adult fits horizontally, even if the adult gets stuck inside a ceiling.

Thrown eggs now try to fit any spawned chickens horizontally so there is space for the spawned mob. If there is no space, the chicken will not spawn.

Ender pearls can no longer teleport dead players.

Fireballs, wind charges, and wither skulls now store an `acceleration_power` double tag instead of a `power` double list tag in their NBT.
