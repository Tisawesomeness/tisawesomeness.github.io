---

The first snapshot for 1.20.3 is out!

## Shields

Shields now block attacks in the direction the player's **head** is facing, rather than the direction the player's **body** is facing, fixing [MC-109101](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-109101).

## Decorated Pots

Decorated pots set the `cracked` block property to true immediately before breaking if the pot was mined by a tool in the `#breaks_decorated_pots` tag without silk touch. The decorated pot loot table now checks for the `cracked` property instead of the tool used.

## Mobs

Mobs can no longer gain potion effects through splash potion or area of effect clouds while dead or dying, fixing [MC-114761](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-114761).

## Tags

The `#undead` and `#zombies` entity type tags were added.

Skeleton horses were added to the `#skeleton` entity type tag.

## Realms

The following text was added, but unused:

> Realms are now available in Snapshots starting with Snapshot 23w41a. Every Realms subscription comes with a free Snapshot Realm that is separate from your normal Java Realm!
