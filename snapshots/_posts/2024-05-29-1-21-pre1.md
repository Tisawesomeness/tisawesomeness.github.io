Leashable boats, portal-able entities, and many hidden changes. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-pre-release-1).

## Blocks

Trial Spawners and Vaults now take **75 seconds** to mine instead of 250 seconds, regardless of tool used. Both blocks will drop items if given a loot table in a datapack, regardless of tool used.

## Entities

Slimes now use the same attack range calculations as other mobs, fixing [MC-272079](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-272079).

Ender pearls thrown through portals cannot teleport sleeping players.

### Wind Charge

When a wind charge hits a block, the explosion is created 0.25 blocks away from that block in the normal direction.

When a player is launched by a non-Breeze wind charge or the Wind Burst enchantment, fall damage reduction will not be reset within 2 seconds of the launch by touching a ladder, using the Elytra, or using a trident. The `current_impulse_context_reset_grace_time` int field in the player's NBT stores the 40-tick countdown. Fixes [MC-271971](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-271971).

## Enchantments

Wind Burst explosion knockback multipliers were changed to be more similar to Bedrock Edition:

| Level          | Knockback Multiplier |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| Wind Burst I   | 1.2                  |
| Wind Burst II  | 1.75                 |
| Wind Burst III | 2.2                  |
| Wind Burst IV  | 2.55                 |
| Wind Burst V   | 2.9                  |
| ...            | ...                  |

Wind Burst levels 4 and up use the formula `1.15 + 0.35 * level` to calculate the knockback multiplier.
