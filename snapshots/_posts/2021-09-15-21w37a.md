The first non-experimental 1.18 snapshot is out! See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-21w37a).

# Buffed Copper in Dripstone Caves

Copper ore veins (not the huge veins added in 1.18) now generate with about twice as much copper in dripstone caves.

# Axolotl Mob Cap

Previously, both axolotls and glow squids counted towards the `underground_water_creature` mob cap, 5 mobs total. Now, axolotls are part of the `axolotls` mob cap, and glow squids are the only mobs that are part of the `underground_water_creature` mob cap. Both caps hold 5 mobs per player.
