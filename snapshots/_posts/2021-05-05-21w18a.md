Another smaller snapshot that makes screaming goats use their ram attack more often. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-21w18a).

# Screaming Goat Ramming

Regular goats have a 600-6000 tick cooldown (30 seconds to 5 minutes, uniform random, both ends inclusive) between rams and on spawn. Screaming goats instead have a **100-300 tick cooldown** (5 seconds to 15 seconds, uniform random, both ends inclusive).
