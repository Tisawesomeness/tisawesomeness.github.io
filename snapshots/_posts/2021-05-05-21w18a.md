Another smaller snapshot that makes screaming goats use their ram attack more often.

# Screaming Goat Ramming

Regular goats have a 600-6000 tick cooldown (30 seconds to 5 minutes, uniform random, both ends inclusive) between rams and on spawn. Screaming goats instead have a **100-300 tick cooldown** (5 seconds to 15 seconds, uniform random, both ends inclusive). If the ram fails, goats have a **100 tick** (5 second) cooldown.

**Goats will no longer ram players on Peaceful** (this was not in the changelog).
