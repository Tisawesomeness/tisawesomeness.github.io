Another bugfix pre-release.

## Happy Ghast

When there are no players on top of the Happy Ghast, excluding passengers, it will always start moving again after half a second, fixing [MC-298510](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-298510).

The Happy Ghast will now stay still for 3 seconds when it is loaded.
