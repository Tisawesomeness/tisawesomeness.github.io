This snapshot overhauls leash mechanics.

## Leash Changes

Leashing two mobs to each other now emits an `entity_action` vibration (frequency 4).

Shearing a leash off an entity now emits a `block_attach` vibration (frequency 10).

## Chat Filtering

When a player takes a renamed item out of an anvil, the server sends the item's name to the server's text filtering endpoint (if one is set up). However, the item's name will not be changed.
