The first 1.17 pre-release is out!

# Surge Protector Advancement

The advancement will trigger if lightning stirkes **within 30 blocks of a player**, while an unharmed villager is within a 30x30x30 cuboid centered on the lightning strike, or up to 6 blocks above the cuboid.

# `lightning_strike` Trigger

This trigger is triggered for every player **within 256 blocks** of the lightning strike, *not* everyone on the server like the changelog said.

# Glow Sign Colors

The list of text and outline colors for glow signs is now on the [wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sign#Text) (thanks [Pneuma01](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/UserProfile:Pneuma01) for adding it).
