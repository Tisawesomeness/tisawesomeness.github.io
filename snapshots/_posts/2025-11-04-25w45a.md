This snapshot adds the final 1.21.10 features: netherite horse armor and the coral zombie nautilus.

## Horse Armor

Like netherite nautilus armor, netherite horse armor has **19 armor**, **3 toughness**, and 100% knockback resistance.

## Spear

Spears now consider the attacker and victim's total velocity, not just their horizontal velocity when computing damage, knockback, and range.

## Camel Husk

Camel husks now drop additional rotten flesh when killed with looting:

| ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- |
| Default     | 1/2 | 1/2 |     |     |     | 2.5     |
| Looting I   | 1/4 | 2/4 | 1/4 |     |     | 3       |
