A much smaller snapshot this time.

## Happy Ghast

When the Happy Ghast detects a player on top of itself, it will wait 5 ticks before checking for players again. If it does not detect a player on top of itself after 5 more ticks, the Happy Ghast will start to move again. This behavior is implemented by the `still_timeout` NBT integer field, a value counting down from 10 to 0.

## Entities

Transformed entities now copy their `CustomNameVisible` NBT even if no `CustomName` is set.
