A small release candidate fixes villagers suffocating in minecarts.

## Changes

Villagers and wandering traders now ride 0.1875 blocks lower in minecarts since the last release candidate. Villagers and wandering traders now have no offset from the minecart they're riding (the minecart and villager positions are the same).
