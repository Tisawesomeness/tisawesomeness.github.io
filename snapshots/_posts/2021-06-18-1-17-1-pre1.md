The first 1.17.1 pre-release changes axolotl and goat breeding mechanics, and a buff to drowned copper farms and powder snow farms!.

# Axolotl Breeding

When two axolotls breed, there is a 1/1200 chance for the baby to be the rare variant. If that chance fails, then the baby takes either parent's variant.

# Goat Breeding

Breeding goats will now have a 2% chance for the baby to be a screaming goat.

If one parent is a screaming goat, the baby *may* be a screaming goat (I am not sure what the conditions are, please contact me if you can figure it out). If both parents are screaming goats, the child will also be a screaming goat. (Note that these features were present in the 1.17 release)
