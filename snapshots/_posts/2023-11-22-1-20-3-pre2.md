Another pre-release changes how wind charges behave in water. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-20-3-pre-release-2).

## Wind Charge

Wind charges no longer slow down in still water. Flowing water can still push wind charges like every other entity, but wind charges will no longer slow down automatically just from being in water.

## Tags

Added wind charges to the `#impact_projectiles` entity type tag, fixing [MC-266496](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-266496).
