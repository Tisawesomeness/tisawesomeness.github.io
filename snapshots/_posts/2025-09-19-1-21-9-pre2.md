The second 1.21.9 pre-release further tweaks the copper golem.

## Copper Golem

Copper golems now wait **60-99 ticks** after spawning before sorting items, instead of only 60 ticks before.

When a copper golem is fully oxidized, it will start trying to turn into a statue on the next tick. Then, there is a **0.58% chance** every tick the golem will try to turn into a statue. On average, copper golems attempt to turn into a statue once every 172 ticks.

To reach a chest horizontally, the copper golem’s hitbox must be less than **1 block** from the chest’s hitbox in both the X and Z axes (chessboard distance). While the copper golem is pathfinding to the chest, its range is reduced to 0.5 blocks.

Copper golems no longer check if their target chest is unreachable while queuing.
