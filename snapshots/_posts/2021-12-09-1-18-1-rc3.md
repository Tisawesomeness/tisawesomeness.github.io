1.18.3-rc3 fixes a critical security issue.

# Details

There are no changes other than the security fix. Mojang has also released a [temporary fix](https://twitter.com/slicedlime/status/1469150993527017483) in the launcher for versions 1.12+. To get the fix, stop any running instances of Minecraft and the launcher, then restart.

~~**Do not** play Minecraft on versions below 1.12 [until further notice](https://twitter.com/slicedlime/status/1469150995842310144).~~ Mojang has made an [official announcement](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-message--security-vulnerability-java-edition) on the vulnerability. Read it before playing Minecraft or running a server.

Since there are still vulnerable Minecraft versions, I will not cover how the vulnerability works.
