This snapshot adds Player NPCs and bugfixes. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-25w36a).

## Copper Golem

A copper golem previously chose its target chest by computing the distance between its **block position** and each chest's center, then picking the closest distance. Now, copper golems compute the distance between its **exact position** and each chest's center, fixing [MC-300416](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-300416).

## Mannequin

Mannequins only have a player's appearance, they do not have any player behavior. Mannequins do not load chunks. Like players, their tracking range is 32 chunks and they update every 2 ticks.

A mannequin with the "Dinnerbone" or "Grumm" skin will not render upside-down. The display name must be set to "Dinnerbone" or "Grumm" for the mannequin to render upside-down.

Mannequins do not support deadmau5's ears.

## Misc

Players can no longer spectate marker entities with the `/spectate` command, fixing [MC-223142](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-223142).

The name for "Anonymous Player" in the server list can now be translated through the `multiplayer.status.anonymous_player` translation string.
