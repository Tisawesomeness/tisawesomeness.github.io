A long-requested feature, fallen trees. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-25w09a).

## Blocks

In addition to dead bushes, dry grass and tall dry grass can now be placed on farmland.

Leaf litter can now only be placed on blocks with a full top face, fixing [MC-280121](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-280121).

## Misc

Random ticks now only occur in entity-ticking chunks, fixing [MC-280155](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-280155).
