A new snapshot adds telemetry tweaks and fixes an 11 year old bug. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-23w18a).

## Sniffer

The sniffer's height decreases by 0.4 blocks (from 1.75 to 1.35 blocks) when digging. The sniffer's eye height decreases from 1.14 to 0.81 blocks.

## Supporting Block

To fix [MC-1133](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-1133), the game now calculates which block the player is standing on (the "supporting block") differently.

The game finds all blocks the collide with the entity's hitbox extended 0.000001 blocks downward. Out of those blocks, the block whose center has the shortest distance to the entity's center is the supporting block. If two blocks have the same distance, then the block with the higher Y coordinate wins. If the Y coordinates are the same, then the block with the higher Z coordinate wins, then the block with the higher X coordinate wins.

## Structures

Desert pyramids no longer generate sand outside its bounding box.

Fixed a bug where strongholds would incorrectly generate a torch instead of a wall torch.

## Telemetry

### Launcher Name

The official launcher sets the system property to `minecraft-launcher`. Launching the game through an external launcher or as a server leaves the system property blank.

### Advancement Made

The `advancement_made` optional telemetry event is sent when the player completes an advancement or unlocks a recipe.

> Understanding the context behind receiving an advancement can help us better understand and improve the progression of the game

| Property                                       | Content                            | Notes                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Advancement ID<br />`advancement_id`           | A namespaced ID                    | The event is only sent if the advancement namespace is `minecraft` |
| Game Time (Ticks)<br />`advancement_game_time` | Ticks elapsed since world creation | Unaffected by `/time set`                                          |

### Game Load Times

The `game_load_times` optional telemetry event is sent when the game completely finishes loading.

> This event can help us figure out where improvements to startup performance are needed by measuring execution times of the startup phases

| ID                             | Property                                | Notes                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `load_time_bootstrap_ms`       | Bootstrap Time (Milliseconds)           | Time elapsed creating and verifying registries             |
| `load_time_pre_window_ms`      | Time Before Window Opens (Milliseconds) |                                                            |
| `load_time_loading_overlay_ms` | Time in Loading Screen (Milliseconds)   | Does not include fade time                                 |
| `load_time_total_time_ms`      | Total Load Time (Milliseconds)          | Property not sent if resource packs initially fail to load |
