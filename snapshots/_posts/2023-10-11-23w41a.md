Decorated pots can now store items! See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-23w41a).

## Decorated Pots

Added two sounds: `block.decorated_pot.insert` "Decorated Pot fills" and `block.decorated_pot.insert_fail` "Decorated Pot wobbles". The pitch for the decorated pot insert sound ranges from 0.7 to 1.2 depending on how full the pot is.

## Signs

Added the sound `block.sign.waxed_interact_fail` "Sign wobbles" for when trying to wax a sign that's already waxed.

## Gamerules

`maxCommandForkCount` defaults to 65536.
