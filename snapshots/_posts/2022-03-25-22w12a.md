The second 1.19 snapshot is out, adding the Warden.

Some features are ported from the [experimental snapshot](/snapshots/1-19-experimental-1), so read that post to get up to speed.

# Boat Chest

The boat chest hitbox size is 1.375×0.5625×1.375, just like a regular boat.

**Opening or breaking a boat chest will make piglins angry.**

DIspensers cannot dispense boats with chests.

# Mangrove

Mangrove leaves can now be used as compost with a 30% chance to increase the composter by one level, fixes [MC-249303](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-249303).

Mangrove fences and fence gates give 300 ticks of fuel, fixes [MC-249316](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-249316). Mangrove boats give 1200 ticks of fuel, the same as other boats.

# Mud Bricks

The mud brick slab's hardness was changed to 1.5, and the blast resistance was changed to 3. Mud brick slabs now have the same properties as other mud brick blocks and fixes [MC-249312](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-249312).

# Sculk

**A sculk sensor now activates when a player steps on it**, even if sneaking.

**All players** within a 16 block radius will have their warning level increased when a shrieker is activated. If the players have different warning levels, then everyone gets the warning level of the most warned player.

Unlike the experimental snapshot, the shrieker is unobtainable, even with a silk touch hoe.

# Warden

Knockback resistance was changed from 1.25 to 1, still full knockback immunity.

The digging animation now lasts for **100 ticks** (5 seconds) instead of 110 ticks. When a warden's target dies, the 1200 tick (1 minute) digging cooldown will reset, meaning **the warden will wait at least 1 minute before digging and despawning.**

The sniffing animation now lasts for 84 ticks (4.2 seconds) instead of 68 ticks.

The warden gives the darkness effect to nearby players for 12 seconds, down from 30 seconds.

The warden now has a 1.5 `attack_knockback` attribute, doing the same knockback as a ravager.

## Anti-Cheese

The warden is **no longer an undead mob**, so Smite will not work.

The warden is only slowed down by 2% in liquids, compared to 20% for most mobs. **The warden cannot be pushed by flowing liquids.** Note that the warden must be on land to dig and despawn.

**The warden is completely immune to lava.**

The warden can now swim. If the warden is covered in water up to `2.2185` blocks, it will swim by jumping every tick with an 80% chance.

The attack range was increased to `sqrt(8)` or `2.828` blocks. The attack range is calculated from the center of the warden (at `y=1.45`) to the player's feet. If you are on the same y level as the warden, you must stay **2.429** blocks away or pillar **4.279** blocks up to not get hit. The equation for the distance `d` you must stay away from the warden if you are `y` blocks above it is:

![d = sqrt(8 - (y - 1.45)^2), 1.45 - sqrt(8) < y < 1.45 + sqrt(8), -1.379 < y < 4.279](/snapshots/img/22w12a-warden-range.png)

## Anger

The warden will add 20 anger for projectiles, and 35 anger for everything else. Snowballs are no longer treated specially. However, anger will only increase for projectiles if the shooter is within a **30 block radius**.

If a player makes the warden angrier, and the warden has at least the Angry level towards that player, then the warden will immediately switch targets to that player.

If the warden is directly hurt by an entity, or indirectly hurt by an entity within five blocks, the warden will add 100 anger towards that entity.

Player collision is checked every tick, but the anger increase from collision has a one second cooldown.

Anger now decrements by **1 every second**, instead of by 1 every 3 seconds.

# Tags

The `#chest_boats` item tag and the `#warden_events_can_listen` game event tag was added.

# Update Suppression

Mojang confirmed that the update suppression fix last snapshot is [intended](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-249082). The update order change, however, was a bug and is now [fixed](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-249181).

# Miscallaneous Changes

Bees will not try to pollinate any underwater blocks.

Iron golem attacks now respect knockback resistance.

The eating game event triggers from the exact eye position, not the eye block position.

Crafting and smelting recipes are cached for performance.
