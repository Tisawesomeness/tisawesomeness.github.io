The first 1.20 pre-release is out, adding universal dyeing and fixing an ancient bug.

## Recipes

The old recipe for dyeing 8 carpets was replaced with the new recipe for dyeing a single carpet at a time.

## Death Messages

Two new death messages were added for dying outside the world border:

> `<player>` left the confines of this world

> `<player>` left the confines of this world whilst fighting `<attacker>`

The death message for `/kill` is now:

> `<player>` was killed

## Misc

Flying mobs are now affected by the properties of the block 0.5 blocks below them, rather than the block 1 block below.

When a player's game mode switches to spectator, their y velocity is stopped, fixing [MC-146582](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-146582).
