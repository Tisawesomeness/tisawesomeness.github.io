This massive snapshot adds Trial Chambers and the Breeze.

## Breeze

The breeze has **30 health** and is **immune to fall damage**. It has a movement speed attribute of 0.6. The breeze is 0.6 blocks wide and 1.7 blocks tall. Its eye height is 1.445 blocks high.

Breezes only drop 5 experience.

Shooting a breeze with an arrow or trident from a player will cause the projectile to lose half its speed and deflect in a random direction. If the arrow or trident is not owned by a player, it will pass through the breeze without doing damage.

Breezes have an attack damage attribute of 2 even though they have no melee attack.

### AI

Breezes avoid trapdoors and magma blocks.

Breezes only attack players and will not retaliate against other mobs. Breezes can track players from 24 blocks horizontally and 24 blocks vertically.

The breeze fights by alternating wind charge shots with long jumps and a "slide" that causes the breeze to move quickly around the player. It performs a long jump or slide, then a wind charge shot, then a long jump or slide, and so on. However, it may long jump or slide twice in a row if the conditions for shooting are not met. Even if the conditions for long jumping and sliding are not met, the breeze will not shoot twice in a row.

If the conditions are met for multiple actions, then the breeze will prioritize shooting, then long jumping, then sliding. The three actions are mutually exclusive.

### Idling

If the breeze cannot shoot, long jump, or slide, it has a 50-50 chance to do nothing for 1-5 seconds or randomly stroll to a location at most 10 blocks away horizontally and 7 blocks away vertically.

### Shooting

The breeze can shoot if:
- It has an attack target
- It is on the ground
- The target is between **2-16 blocks** away
- It finished a long jump within the past 5 seconds or a slide within the past 3 seconds
- Shooting is not on cooldown (10 ticks)
- It will not shoot twice in a row without long jumping or sliding in between

The breeze inhales for **15 ticks**, then shoots a wind charge if the target is within a 120 degree cone of the Breeze's facing direction. Afterwards, it recovers for **4 ticks**.

The wind charge is spawned at the "snout" of the breeze, at 1.045 blocks high, and is aimed from the breeze's midpoint (0.85 blocks high) to 30% of the target's height (0.54 blocks high). This gives the wind charge a slight downwards bias.

Wind charges are shot 43.75% as fast as a skeleton's arrow, though its speed from shot to shot varies.

The wind charge's accuracy is based on the world difficulty. Its "uncertainty" (or "error" or "lack of accuracy") value is 1 on easy, 3 on medium, and 7 on hard (compared to 10/6/2 for skeletons). Note that the wind charge is **less** accurate on higher difficulties.

### Wind Charge

Wind charges are 0.3125 (5/16) blocks wide and tall, but they can deflected by punching anywhere 1 block outwards from its hitbox (or within a 2.3125 block long cube).

Wind charges are not affected by gravity and can be pushed by water.

Direct hits do **1 damage regardless of difficulty**. Wind charges cannot collide with other wind charges.

When a wind charge hits a block or entity, it explodes with a random power from **3.0 to 4.0**. The explosion acts exactly like other explosions, except they don't deal damage to blocks or entities. Wind charge explosions can push other wind charges.

### Long Jump

The breeze can long jump if:
- It has an attack target
- It is on the ground
- It is not in water
- The target is between **4-24 blocks** away
- The four blocks above the breeze's position are air or water (includes waterlogged blocks)
- It has not finished a long jump within the past 5 seconds or a slide within the past 3 seconds
- It has not failed a slide within the past second

Honey blocks do not prevent the breeze from long jumping.

The breeze picks a random angle behind the target's head rotation direction to jump towards. The most likely angle is right behind the target's head, but the angle varies according to a [Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) with a standard deviation of 45 degrees. Although rare, it is possible for a breeze to jump in front of its target. Then, the breeze picks a random point 4-8 blocks in that angle from the target. In other words, the breeze picks a random point in a 4-8 block ring around the target, where the points directly behind the target's head are the most common.

The breeze can jump to blocks at the chosen point or up to 10 blocks below. If there are no blocks below, then the breeze will not jump and can try again next tick.

The breeze will only jump if it has line of sight with either the point it will jump to or 4 blocks above. Liquids and parts of blocks without collision do not block line of sight. If line of sight is blocked, then the breeze will not jump and can try again next tick.

The breeze inhales for **10 ticks** while looking at its jump target, then jumps. The breeze ignores friction until it lands.

The breeze uses the same jump mechanics as goats and frogs, except it does not check if its jump arc has enough space to jump. A jump attempt fails if its initial velocity would be greater than 1.4 blocks/sec. It tries 40, 55, 60, 75, and 80 degree angle jumps in a random order until one succeeds. If none succeed, the long jump fails, and the breeze can try again next tick.

### Sliding

The breeze can slide if:
- It has an attack target
- It is on the ground
- It is not in water
- It has not finished a long jump within the past 5 seconds or a slide within the past 3 seconds
- It has not failed a slide within the past 3 seconds

If the target is within **0-4 blocks**, the breeze will slide away to a random block in a 90 degree radius away from the target, and at most 5 blocks away horizontally and 5 blocks away vertically from the breeze's starting position.

If the target is within **4-8 blocks**, the breeze will slide to a random block within 5 blocks horizontally and 3 blocks vertically.

If the target is within **8-20 blocks**, the breeze will slide directly towards the player towards a block that is 4-8 blocks away from the player.

If the target is 20 or more blocks away, or the breeze cannot find a valid block to pathfind to, then the slide "fails" and the breeze cannot long jump for 1 second or slide for 3 seconds.

The breeze generates much more ground particles when sliding compared to moving around.

## Trial Spawner

The trial spawn has **50 hardness and blast resistance**. It has no assigned tool and takes **4 minutes, 10 seconds to mine**.

Trial spawners emit **light level 8** when active, waiting to eject rewards, or ejecting rewards. They emit **light level 4** when waiting for players.

### Spawning

Mobs spawn within a **4 block radius** in the x and z directions (unless overridden by the `spawn_range` tag), and a 1 block radius in the y direction.

Mobs only spawn in locations that have visual line of sight with the spawner, though liquids do not block line of sight.

Standard mob spawning rules apply, excluding light levels.

If a spawned mob is more than **47 blocks** away from the spawner or switches dimensions, the spawner considers that mob "defeated". Even though that mob is no longer part of the fight, it will never despawn.

### Rewards

When all mobs are defeated, the spawner waits for **2 seconds** before ejecting a reward **every 1.5 seconds** for each player.

The trial spawner picks a loot table from `loot_tables_to_eject`, then picks random items from that loot table for all players. **In trial chambers, this means all players will get keys or all players will get consumables.**

### Block Data

| Tag                                                                                             | Type  | Range | Default |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| Player detection range<br>`required_player_range`                                               | int   | 1-128 | 14      |
| Horizontal mob spawn radius<br>`spawn_range`                                                    | int   | 1-128 | 4       |
| Total mobs spawned<br>`total_mobs`                                                              | float | ≥0.0  | 6.0     |
| Amount of total mobs added per additional player<br>`total_mobs_added_per_player`               | float | ≥0.0  | 2.0     |
| Number of spawned mobs that can exist simultaneously<br>`simultaneous_mobs`                     | float | ≥0.0  | 2.0     |
| Amount of simultaneous mobs added per additional player<br>`simultaneous_mobs_added_per_player` | float | ≥0.0  | 1.0     |
| Ticks between spawn attempts<br>`ticks_between_spawn`                                           | int   | ≥0    | 40      |
| Ticks spawner is on cooldown<br>`target_cooldown_length`                                        | int   | ≥0    | 36000   |

The computed total and simultaneous mobs for all players in the fight is **rounded down**. For example, if `total_mobs` is 1, and `total_mobs_added_per_player` is 0.5, then a 3 player fight will spawn 2 total mobs.

If an entity defined in the `spawn_potentials` tag only contains the `id` tag, the trial spawner will spawn the mob as if it were a natural spawn, taking the local difficulty into account (such as spawning armor on zombies).

If an entity defined in the `spawn_potentials` tag contains the `Pos` tag, the entity will spawn at that position.

Trial spawners ignore the `custom_spawn_rules` tag.

## Trial Chambers

[Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tisawesomeness/StructureWorlds/main/TrialChamber/TrialChamber23w45a.zip) a world containing every trial chamber structure template.

### Placement

Trial chambers start generating between y=-40 and y=-20, inclusive.

The world is split into 32×32 chunk squares, and a trial chamber is placed in a random position within each square (unless generation fails). Trial chambers are at least 8 chunks away from each other in each x and z directions and at most 56 chunks away.

### Spawners

\* The slime spawner has a 75% chance to spawn a medium slime (size 2, `Size` tag 1) and a 25% chance to spawn a "medium" slime (size 3, `Size` tag 2). "Medium" slimes split into 2-4 small slimes on death. "Medium" slimes do not spawn naturally.

Some ranged trial spawners are slow variants that spawn more mobs at once but at a slower rate.

### Processor List

The `trial_chambers_copper_bulb_degradation` processor list replaces waxed copper bulbs with the following chances:
- Keep as waxed copper bulbs (30%)
- Exposed copper bulbs (30%)
- Weathered copper bulbs (30%)
- Oxidized copper bulbs (10%)

Note that the replacement blocks are not waxed.

## Tags

Added the `#breeze_immune_to` damage type tag.

Added the `#deflects_arrows` and `#deflects_tridents` tags. Endermen are not in either tag because they teleport away from arrows instead of deflecting them.

Added the `#has_structure/trial_chambers` biome tag.

## Particles

Added four new particles:

```
gust
gust_dust
gust_emitter
trial_spawner_detection
```
