New copper decorations and bug fixes. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-25w32a).

## Blocks

All copper bars, chains, and lanterns share hardness and blast resistance with their iron counterparts. All new copper blocks weather at the same rate as other copper blocks.

The blast resistance of exposed, weathered, and oxidized copper golem statues changed from 2.5 to 6, the same as the unaffected copper golem statue.

Hanging signs can be crafted with any chain variant, or any combination of chain variants. The resulting sign will still have iron chains.

## Entities

Entities no longer emit an `entity_dismount` vibration (frequency 5) when a vehicle changes dimension or is unloaded.

[MC-295841](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-295841) was not fixed.

## Command-Line Options

Removed the client's `--userProperties` and `--profileProperties` options, which were unused in the previous snapshot.
