Movement fix reverts and more datapack changes. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-25w04a).

## Movement

Player movement was **not** reverted to 1.21.4 behavior. Instead, the [MC-271065](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-271065) and [MC-152728](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-152728) bugs were manually re-added. Other movement-related bugs fixed in 25w02a are still patched.

Under normal circumstances, players move at max speed when moving at a 45° angle from where they are looking. If a player uses a mod that enables analog input, such as on a controller, they can move at max speed by moving at an angle from 11.479° to 78.520°.

## Entities

Cats spawned by witch huts no longer despawn naturally.

## Data Components

The `provides_banner_patterns` component is **not** hash-prefixed, unlike what the changelog says. See [MC-279698](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-279698).

## GameTest

The Test Block's `test_block_mode` block state was renamed to `mode`.

## Edits
