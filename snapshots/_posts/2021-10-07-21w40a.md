A new snapshot is out, buffing copper ore.

# Copper Ore Drops

Copper ore now drops between 2-5 ore without fortune, chosen uniformly. The drops for each fortune level are shown in the table below.

| | No Fortune | Fortune I | Fortune II | Fortune III |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Avg | 3.5 | 4.67 | 6.125 | 7.7 |
| Max | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 |

# Mob Spawns

Axolotls now only spawn **exactly 1 block above a clay block**. If the block directly below an axolotl is not clay, it will not spawn.

Since mob spawns are picked from a weighted sum, and zombie spawns were added back to dripstone caves, drowned now spawn *slightly* less.

# New Random Number Generator?

A new XoroshiroRandomSource class is in the code, but the world generator does not use it by default. It is a random number generator based on the [Xoroshiro128++](https://prng.di.unimi.it/xoshiro128plusplus.c) algorithm. It is **not** cryptographically secure, but it is significantly less exploitable than the default Java random number generator. This could mean that exploits such as the "swamp clay trick" or the "lapis trick" will become much harder. Set `legacy_random_source` to `false` in the noise generator settings test out the new RNG.
