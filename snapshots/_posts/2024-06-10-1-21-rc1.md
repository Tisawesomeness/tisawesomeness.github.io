The first 1.21 release candidate is out. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-release-candidate-1).

## Enchantments

Fire Protection now gives 15% burn time reduction per level and Blast Protection now gives 15% explosion knockback resistance per level, the same as in 1.20.6. These effects stack if used on multiple armor pieces.

If a player has 7 levels total of Fire Protection, they are extinguished immediately when catching fire. If a player has 7 levels total of Blast Protection, they do not take knockback from explosions.

These changes bring Fire Protection into parity with Bedrock Edition.
