This pre-release buffs diamond ore, nerfs emerald ore, and introduces a couple stealth fixes.

# Ore Generation

Diamond ore now generates from **y levels 0-15** again instead of 0-16. This will make diamonds slightly more common when mining at levels 0-15.

Emerald ore generation was nerfed from 6-24 per chunk to **3-8 per chunk**. Ranges are uniform, both ends inclusive.

# Stealth Changes

Servers will only process the first 200 pages for edit book packets, and the first 128 slots for container click packets.

Added error handling for when the server sends the client a set player team packet that has an unkown team. Likely a crash fix.
