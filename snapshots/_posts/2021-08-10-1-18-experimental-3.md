The third experimental snapshot for 1.18 is out, with some **major** mob spawning changes!

# Mob Caps

Mob caps are now per player. Every tick, all mobs within the spawning radius (128 blocks) of each player are added to that player's mob caps. The same mob can be part of multiple player's caps if it is in range of both players. Mobs from mob spawners **do** count towards the cap.
