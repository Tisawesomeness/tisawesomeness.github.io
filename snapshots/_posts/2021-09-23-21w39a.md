The third 1.18 snapshot is out, and old worlds can finally be opened again.

# Drowned Spawns

In dripstone caves, zombies no longer spawn, and drowned can spawn in underwater aquifers. Drowned spawn at the same rate and group size as zombies.

# Advancements

A player must be at **y level 319** or above while trading to get the Star Trader advancement.

To get the Caves & Cliffs advancement, a player must fall **at least 379 blocks, from 319 or above to -59 or below.**

Note that the advancement y levels are hardcoded. Custom world heights will not change the advancement conditions.
