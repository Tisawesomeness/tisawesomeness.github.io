A massive snapshot adding the final 1.21 features. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w13a).

## The Mace

### Damage

The bonus damage from a mace smash attack now **adds** to the mace's regular damage (after weapon charge but before crits) rather than acting as a multiplier. Smash attacks now do the same damage regardless of weapon charge or damage attributes, though critical hits still multiply smash attack damage by 1.5.

The mace's total damage (when the player falls more than 1.5 blocks to do a smash attack) can be calculated as follows:

- `base` = The base damage of the weapon after attribute modifiers, defaults to 7 for the mace.
- `charge` = The damage multiplier from 0-1 due to the weapon's charge, see the [wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Damage#Attack_cooldown) for details.
- `crit` = The damage multiplier due to critical hits. 1.5 if the attack is a critical hit, or 1 otherwise.
- `enchantmentBonus` = Bonus damage added due to enchantments such as Smite or Bane of Arthopods, but **not Density**. Enchantment bonus is affected by weapon charge differently than normal damage, see the [wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Damage#Attack_cooldown) for details.

$$ \text{maceBonus} = (3 + \text{densityLevel}) \cdot \text{fallHeight} $$

$$ \text{damage} = (\text{base} \cdot \text{charge} + \text{maceBonus}) \cdot \text{crit} + \text{enchantmentBonus} $$

Assuming the mace has default attributes and the player is swinging a fully charged mace, the damage formula becomes:

$$ 7 + (3 + \text{densityLevel}) \cdot \text{fallHeight} + 2.5 \cdot \text{smiteOrBaneLevel} $$

Assuming a critical hit:

$$ (10.5 + 1.5 \cdot (3 + \text{densityLevel}) \cdot \text{fallHeight}) + 2.5 \cdot \text{smiteOrBaneLevel} $$

### Knockback

Entities within **3.5 blocks** (up from 2.5 blocks) of the attacked entity are knocked back from a smash attack. The knockback's velocity was increased by 16.667%.

If a player does a smash attack after falling for more than 5 blocks, nearby entities are knocked back with twice as much velocity as normal.

The mace's smash attack no longer knocks back entities on the same scoreboard team as the player.

### Enchantments

The mace has **15** [enchantability](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanting_mechanics#Enchantability), the same as netherite.

| Enchantment | Weight | [Anvil cost](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Anvil_mechanics#Costs_for_combining_enchantments) per level | Treasure                                         | Can be found in normal loot                       |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Density     | 10     | 1                                                                                                 | No                                               | Yes                                               |
| Breach      | 2      | 4 (item), 2 (book)                                                                                | No                                               | Yes                                               |
| Wind Burst  | 2      | 4 (item), 2 (book)                                                                                | No[\*](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-269977) | Yes[\*](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-270125) |

After the enchanting table calculates the [modified enchantment level](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanting_mechanics#How_enchantments_are_chosen), it uses the below table to determine which enchantments are possible for a given modified enchantment level:

| Enchantment |   I   |  II   |  III  |  IV   |   V   |
| ----------- |:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Density     | 1-12  | 12-23 | 23-34 | 34-45 | 45-56 |
| Breach      | 15-65 | 24-74 | 33-83 | 42-92 |   -   |
| Wind Burst  | 15-65 | 24-74 | 33-83 |   -   |   -   |

#### Density

Using commands to create a mace with density 6 or higher continues to add damage per block fallen.

#### Breach

Each level of breach **completely negates** 15% damage reduction from armor. For example, if a player's armor protected them from 50% of damage, then a weapon with Breach II would lower the protection to 20%. Breach **does not bypass** enchantments or resistance.

| Enchantment level | Armor negation |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Breach I          | 15%            |
| Breach II         | 30%            |
| Breach III        | 45%            |
| Breach IV         | 60%            |
| Breach V          | 75%            |
| Breach VI         | 90%            |
| Breach VII+       | 100%           |

Note that level V and greater is only accessible through commands.

The below formula gives the damage taken before enchantments or resistance is applied, where `d` = damage, `a` = armor, `t` = toughness, and `b` = breach level:

$$ \text{totalDamage} = d \cdot \left( 1 - \max\left( 0, \frac{\max(\frac{a}{5}, a - \frac{4d}{t + 8})}{25} - 0.15 \cdot b \right) \right) $$

#### Wind Burst

Hitting an enemy with a weapon with the Wind Burst enchantment will create a non-damaging explosion at the attacker's feet position. The explosion has radius 3.5 and **power 7**. The explosion's knockback changes with level:

| Enchantment Level | Knockback Multiplier |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Wind Burst I      | 50%                  |
| Wind Burst II     | 75%                  |
| Wind Burst III    | 100%                 |

Higher levels of wind burst currently [crash the game](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-270004).

Unlike player-shot wind charges, explosions from the Wind Burst enchantment [do not reduce fall damage](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-269985).

## Potion Effects

All of the 4 new brewable potion effects only have **one level**, and using commands to get higher levels does not change any behavior.

### Wind Charged

When the entity's death animation completes, a non-damaging explosion is created at the center of the entity's bounding box. The explosion has a random radius from 3-5, which translates to a **random power from 6-10**.

### Weaving

When the entity's death animation completes, the game has an equal chance of attempting to spawn a maximum of **1, 2, or 3 cobwebs**.

The game picks 10 random blocks within a **7×7×7 block cube** centered on the entity's position, then chooses valid blocks until the maximum is reached or there are no blocks left. Only air blocks above a block with a top face that is a full square are valid.

### Oozing

When the entity's death animation completes, slimes are spawned at the entity's position shifted upwards by 0.5 blocks.

### Infested

Affected entities have a 5% chance to spawn **1-3** silverfish when hurt, **not** 1-2 as stated in the changelog. The silverfish are spawned at the entity's position shifted upwards by 0.5 blocks.

## Bad Omen

### Ominous Bottle

Pillager raid captains drop ominous bottles, with an equal chance for any level from 1-5. If the pillager belongs to a raid or there is an ongoing raid at the pillager's position, the pillager will not drop an ominous bottle.

Drinking the bottle gives 1 nutrition and 0.2 saturation.

### Raid Omen

Every tick, the game checks if a player with Bad Omen is in a village and converts the effect to Raid Omen. If a level 5 raid is ongoing at the player's position, Bad Omen will not convert to Raid Omen.

When Bad Omen is converted to Raid Omen, the player's position at that moment is saved as `raid_omen_position` in the player's NBT data. The game searches for claimed POIs and determines the initial raid center from that position, rather than from the player's current position. Converting Bad Omen to Raid Omen again will update the Raid Omen position, and update the potion effect timer using normal potion mechanics.

**Note that none of the mechanics surrounding searching for villages and moving the raid center have changed.** The only thing that changed is the location where the game first searches for claimed POIs and calculates the raid center.

Raid Omen is converted to a raid when the effect has 1 tick left, so the delay before a raid starts is 599 ticks instead of 600 ticks.

Higher levels of Raid Omen function the same as Raid Omen V.

### Trial Omen

Trial spawners try to detect players in range once per second. When a player comes in range of a non-ominous trial spawner, each level of Bad Omen is converted to 15 minutes of Trial Omen, up to a maximum of 1 hour, 15 minutes for Bad Omen V.

Converting Bad Omen to Trial Omen again will update the potion effect timer using normal potion mechanics.

Higher levels of Trial Omen function the same as Trial Omen I.

## Trial Spawner

Trial spawners now only try to detect players in range **once per second**. Unlike vaults, trial spawners do not detect players on a global timer.

Trial spawners activate if a player's eyes have **visual** line of sight with the center of the trial spawner block. Liquids do not block line of sight. Note that mob spawn positions still only require line of sight to the **spawner**, not the player.

When a trial spawner becomes ominous, all summoned mobs are **despawned** completely, not killed. No items drop, and the mobs do not trigger on-death effects.

### Ominous Item Spawners

Trial spawners summon an `ominous_item_spawner` entity every 8 seconds to drop projectiles on players and mbos. The `cooldown_ends_at` field in the trial spawner's NBT data keeps track of the next time to summon a new entity.

Trial spawners will only drop projectiles if a player the spawner has previously detected is within 14 blocks (or `required_player_range`). Line of sight is not required.

The ominous item spawner displays the item for 3-6 seconds before dispensing it downwards.

#### Location Selection

To choose an entity to spawn the item from, the spawner first picks a random player or summoned mob within 14 blocks of the spawner. Each entity has an equal chance of being picked. Line of sight is not required.

Then, the spawner picks a random point above the chosen entity to drop the item from. It chooses a random direction from north, east south, or west. Then it chooses a random point between 2-5 blocks upward vertically and 0-4 blocks horizontally, shifted upwards by the entity's height.

The spawner does a raycast from the selected entity's feet position to the chosen point above the player. The raycast considers the block's **visual** shape, not the block's hitbox. Fluids are ignored.

Lastly, the trial spawner starts spawning the item in the middle of the block below where the raycast hit or ended. The item will only spawn if that block has no collision.

As a result of the above process, items can only be summoned within the 4 cardinal horizontal directions, with a maximum of 4 blocks outwards and `2 + entityHeight` blocks upwards.

#### Item Selection

All trial spawners within a **30×20×30** section of the world drop the same projectiles. Trial spawners in the same block coordinate but different worlds may not drop the same items.

Trial spawners pick one selection from a pool of lingering potions (Pool 1) and one selection from a pool of other projectiles (Pool 2). The number ranges in Pool 2 is a random item **count**, not the item's weight. All selections in Pool 2 are equally likely.

| Pool 1                        | Pool 2                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Wind Charged Lingering Potion | Arrow                    |
| Oozing Lingering Potion       | Arrow of Poison          |
| Infested Lingering Potion     | Arrow of Slowness (II)   |
| Weaving Lingering Potion      | 1-3 Fire Charges         |
| Strength Lingering Potion     | 1-3 Wind Charges         |
| Swiftness Lingering Potion    | 1-3 Bottle o' Enchanting |
| Slow Falling Lingering Potion |                          |

Every time the trial spawner starts to drop an item, it randomly picks either of the two earlier selected items, weighted by the item's **count**. For example, if a trial spawner selected an Oozing Lingering Potion and 2 Fire Charges, there would be a 1/3 chance to drop a potion and a 2/3 chance to drop a fire charge.

### NBT

Trial spawners now have two configuration NBT tags: `normal_config` and `ominous_config`. Each tag has the below fields:

- `spawn_range`
- `total_mobs`
- `total_mobs_added_per_player`
- `simultaneous_mobs`
- `simultaneous_mobs_added_per_player`
- `ticks_between_spawn`
- `items_to_drop_when_ominous`

If `ominous_config` is not present, then it defaults to `normal_config`. When individual entries in `ominous_config` are missing, they default to their corresponding entries in `normal_config`.

`items_to_drop_when_ominous` was added, determining the loot table for the projectiles dropped by ominous item spawners. Defaults to `spawners/trial_chamber/items_to_drop_when_ominous`.

## Ominous Item Spawner

A new entity was added: `ominous_item_spawner`. It has height 0.25 and width 0.25. Ominous item spawners cannot have passengers or be a passenger of another entity. Ominous item spawners ignore pistons and do not trigger redstone components such as pressure plates.

A warning sound plays **36 ticks** (1.8 seconds) before the item drops.

The item is dispensed as if it was shot from a dispenser facing downwards.

### NBT

| Tag                      | Type      | Default    | Description                            |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `item`                   | ItemStack | Empty item | The item to drop                       |
| `spawn_item_after_ticks` | Long      | 0          | Ticks the entity must exist before dropping the item |

If `spawn_item_after_ticks` is 0 or negative, the item will be dispensed immediately.

Note that `spawn_item_after_ticks` currently [does not work](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-269964).

## Trial Chambers

[Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tisawesomeness/StructureWorlds/main/TrialChamber/TrialChamber24w13a.zip) a world containing every trial chamber structure template.

### Spawners

Some ranged trial spawners are slow variants that spawn more mobs at once but at a slower rate.

| Spawner Type                     | Seconds between spawn | Simultaneous mobs             | Total mobs                  |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Default (placed in creative)     | 2                     | 2 + 1 per additional player   | 6 + 2 per additional player |
| Ranged (slow)                    | 8                     | 4 + 2 per additional player   | 6 + 2 per additional player |
| Baby Zombie                      | 1                     | 2 + 0.5 per additional player | 6 + 2 per additional player |
| Breeze                           | 1                     | 1 + 0.5 per additional player | 2 + 1 per additional player |
| Melee, other Small Melee, Ranged | 1                     | 3 + 0.5 per additional player | 6 + 2 per additional player |

The computed total and simultaneous mobs for all players in the fight is **rounded down**.

#### Equipment

If a mob spawned from an ominous trial spawner can wear armor, it has a 50% chance to wear a helmet and a separate 50% chance to wear a chestplate. The material for each armor piece is chosen from the table below:

| Material  | Trim        | Weight | Chance        |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ | ------------- |
| Chainmail | Copper Bolt | 4      | 4/7 = 57.143% |
| Iron      | Copper Flow | 2      | 2/7 = 28.571% |
| Diamond   | Copper Flow | 1      | 1/7 = 14.286% |

### Loot

#### Ominous Trial Spawner

Trial spawners have a 30% chance to drop keys for all players, and a 70% chance to drop items from the below table for all players:

| Item                   | Count | Weight | Chance         |
| ---------------------- | ----- | ------ | -------------- |
| Cooked Beef            | 1-2   | 3      | 3/11 = 27.273% |

| Rotten Flesh           | 1-4   | 1      | 1/11 = 9.091%  |

#### Vault

Normal vaults pull from 3 pools:
- 1 roll, with an 80% chance to pull from rare loot and a 20% chance to pull from common loot
- 1-3 rolls pulling from common loot
- A 25% chance to do 1 roll pulling from unique loot

The chances in the below tables are the chances for getting any of the given item from a **vault**, not the chance of getting the item from the loot table.

### Ominous Vault

Ominous vaults pull from a common, rare, and unique pool just like normal vaults, except the chance to roll for a unique item is **75%** instead of 25%.

The chances in the below tables are the chances for getting any of the given item from an **ominous vault**, not the chance of getting the item from the loot table.

#### Common

| Item              | Count | Weight | Chance  |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| Emerald           | 4-10  | 5      | 66.914% |

| Slowness II Arrow | 4-12  | 3      | 45.408% |
| Diamond           | 2-3   | 2      | 32.203% |

#### Structure Files

The following structures were added and removed. Note that `quadrant_1-5.nbt` is shorthand for `quadrant_1.nbt`, `quadrant_2.nbt`, etc.

## Advancements

The "Who Needs Rockets?" advancement description now says "Use a Wind Charge to launch yourself upward 8 blocks", instead of 7 blocks in the previous snapshot. The advancement still only requires a 7 block launch, but the change was made to account for launch distance lost due to the player jumping. This fixes [MC-269649](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-269649).

## Particles

Added a new particle: `dust_pillar`. The particle is created by mace smash attacks.

`dust_pillar` has the same arguments as other block-based particles such as `block` and `falling_dust`.

## Tags

The damage type tag `#is_player_attack` only contains `player_attack`.

The `#enchantable/fire_aspect` item tag was added.

The `#enchantable/sharp_weapon` item tag was added, controlling which weapons can be enchanted with Sharpness. It contains `#swords` and `#axes` by default.

The `#enchantable/weapon` item tag now references the `#enchantable/sharp_weapon` tag instead of `#swords` and `#axes`.

## Datapacks

`body` is now a slot that can be used in attribute modifiers, fixing [MC-269143](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-269143).

If the `has_raid` or `is_captain` fields are not defined in the `raider` entity sub-predicate, those fields default to false, meaning the predicate will check if there is no raid and the raider is not a captain.

## Edits

### April 1 2024

- Clarified that bad omen changes only affect the **first** time the game creates the raid center, and that the raid center can still be moved.
