The first 1.20 update is out and definitely does not have "no more major features".

## Sniffer

Sniffers have an equal chance to dig up torchflower seeds or a pitcher pod.

Sniffers now avoid powder snow, wither roses, and pointed dripstone.

The sniffer uses the same sniffing mechanics as [23w07a](/snapshots/23w07a), but instead of checking if the block above the target is air, the sniffer checks if it can pathfind to the block.

### Sniffer Egg

Sniffer eggs have 0.5 hardness and blast resistance. Interestingly, they make the same placing, breaking, and footstep sounds as metal blocks such as iron blocks.

Sniffer eggs take 24,000-24,300 ticks to hatch (20 minutes to 20 minutes, 15 seconds). The hatch time decreases to 12,000-12,300 ticks (10 minutes to 10 minutes, 15 seconds) if the egg is placed on a block in the `#sniffer_egg_hatch_boost` tag. The tag contains only moss by default.

## Pitcher Plant

Pitcher pods have 5 stages of growth (age) from 0-4. They grow at the same rate as other crops.

Bonemealing a pitcher pod has a 25% chance to grow it by 2 stages, a 25% chance to grow it by 3 stages, and a 50% chance to grow it by 4 stages.

Pitcher pods have a 30% chance to fill up a composter by one level, and pitcher plants have an 85% chance.

## Suspicious Blocks

Suspicious gravel blocks have a hardness and blast resistance of 0.25, the same as suspicious sand.

The suspicious sand `loot_table` and `loot_table_seed` properties were renamed to `LootTable` and `LootTableSeed` respectively.

## Archaeology Structures

Brushing suspicious blocks in certain structures drops the following items:

### Desert Temple

### Desert Well

### Cold Ocean Ruin

### Warm Ocean Ruin

## Trail Ruins

Trail ruins generate in the following biomes:
- Taiga
- Snowy Taiga
- Old Growth Pine Taiga
- Old Growth Spruce Taiga
- Old Growth Birch Forest
- Jungle

After the structure generates, the sand in the structure is randomly converted to other blocks. Each sand block has a 20% chance to convert to gravel, a 15% chance to convert to dirt, and a 6.4% chance to convert to coarse dirt. Then, blocks in the `#trail_ruins_replaceable` tag (sand, gravel, dirt, and coarse dirt) are converted to suspicious blocks. Each structure piece contains up to 6 suspicious sand and 2 suspicious gravel.

Brushing suspicious blocks in trail ruins drops the following items:

Trail ruins are made up of the following possible structure pieces:
- buildings
  - group_entrance_three_1
  - group_entrance_two_1

## Sculk

Calibrated sculk sensors have the same properties as regular sculk sensors. The hoe is the best tool, and it requires silk touch to drop.

The calibrated sculk sensor recipe unlocks when the player obtains amethyst.

The `#vibration_resonators` tag controls which blocks create sculk resonance vibrations, which is amethyst blocks only by default.

The `dispense_fail`, `piston_contract`, and `piston_extend` vibrations were removed. The `resonate_1` through `resonate_15` vibrations were added to support resonance.

## Potion Effects

| Name | Old | New |

## Particles

The new `cherry_leaves` particle replaces the `dripping_cherry_leaves`, `falling_cherry_leaves`, and `landing_cherry_leaves` particles.

The `egg_crack` particle was added.
