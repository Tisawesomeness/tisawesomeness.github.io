For this year's April Fools snapshot, Mojang adds everything. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/poisonous-potato-update).

## General

This snapshot is a fork of [24w12a](/snapshots/24w12a). The mace elytra nerf and the heavy core waterlogging fixes were backported from [24w13a](/snapshots/24w13a).

To view the new recipes for existing recipe types, run `/recipe give @s *` and look through the recipe book.

## Bonus Chest

Bonus chest is now on by default.

Bonus chests always contain a **Poisonous Potato Plant**, an Iron Hoe, and a Water Bucket. It also contains 4 rolls of 0-8 Bone Meal, and 4 rolls from the below table:

| Item             | Count | Weight |
| ---------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Potato           | 1-8   | 9      |
| Poisonous Potato | 0-4   | 6      |

## Potato Quest

Placing the Poisonous Potato Plant (PPP) in the head slot will start the Potato Quest. The quest guides the player through entering the Poisonous Potato Dimension and defeating Mega Spud.

The quest is completed when the player composts the Potato Staff **and** the PPP's dialogue reaches "April Fools'!". A completion time will be shown on screen.

After **two seconds** of delay, dialogue can be advanced one line by jumping. Only jumping while grounded counts.

All progress, including the timer, resets on death.

The minimum possible completion time (time shown on-screen, not true completion time from world creation) is 10 seconds. This can be achieved by dying (with `keepInventory` true to keep the PPP on the player's head), immediately composting a staff on respawn, then jumping every 2 seconds to advance dialogue 5 times.

### Dialogue

See the [wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Poisonous_Potato_Plant#The_monologue) or the [lang file](https://pastebin.com/xT1TmxEs) for a complete list of PPP dialogue.

When the PPP says,

> It looks like a developer copy-pasted the Ender Eye code for this.
> That means there's a chance these Potato Eyes could break.

It is correct. A significant amount of code was either copy-pasted or reused due to an `extends` clause. Potato Eyes have the same mechanics and chance to break as Eyes of Ender.

### Progression

The potato quest follows the below flowchart:
- Each node in the flowchart is a **chapter** of the quest.
- At any time, the player can jump forwards (rightwards in the diagram) to one of the chapters in a circular node, if the player meets the requirements.
	- For example, players can skip to the `dimension` chapter by entering the potato dimension regardless of progress in the `intro` questline.
- A solid arrow means the player must perform some action to advance to the next chapter.
- A dashed arrow means the next chapter will be started automatically after dialogue is finished.
- A number by an arrow is the amount of dialogue that must pass before the player can advance to the next chapter.
- "Quest Complete" is not a real chapter, it only represents the end of the quest.

Some chapters have requirements not fully described by their chapter name:

| Chapter            | Requirements                                                           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wrote_thoughts`   | Rename any piece of paper in an anvil (feedback is not sent to Mojang) |
| `found_portal`     | Be within 16 blocks horizontally of the center of a Ruined Portatol    |
| `found_colosseum`  | Be within 16 blocks horizontally of the center of a Colosseum          |
| `inside_colosseum` | Be inside the bounding box of a Colosseum                              |

Some chapters also cause events to happen:

| Chapter         | Event                                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `got_paper`     | The player is given a piece of paper                                 |
| `anvil_dropped` | An anvil is dropped 4 blocks in front of the player, 2 blocks upward |
| `got_book`      | The player is given a book titled, "My Minecraft Ideas"              |
| `got_sword`     | The player is given a plain wooden sword                             |

See the [wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Poisonous_Potato_Plant#The_monologue) for the contents of the "My Minecraft Ideas" book.

The `got_quest` chapter infinitely loops its dialogue, excluding the first line.

### Poisonous Potato Plant

Clicking the PPP in the inventory 4 times changes its lore to:

> On closer inspection this
> Poisonous Potato is a plant.

After clicking the PPP 4 times, it behaves like an armor piece and can be "used" or shift-clicked to equip.

If two or more Poisonous Potato Plants are in a container when the player views it, they will try to put a piece of paper in the container and write the following message in order:

> Are you a plant?
> Do you think `<username>` knows?
> I think they know
> Let's stay quiet
> Destroy this message after reading

### NBT Format

Players store quest progress in the `PotatoQuest` string NBT tag. The format is either:
- `potato.quest.<chapter>.jump.<index>`
- `potato.quest.<chapter>.<index>`

Where `<chapter>` is the chapter ID and `<index>` is the line of dialogue, starting at 0.

## Poisonous Potato Dimension

The poisonous potato dimension is **256 blocks tall**, from y=0 to y=255.

Beds are functional, and respawn anchors explode.

Piglins do not convert to zombified variants.

Illager patrols do not spawn. Raids cannot occur in the poisonous potato dimension, players keep the Bad Omen effect when entering a village.

Rain and thunder only happens **below cloud level** at y=112. Riptide and channeling tridents therefore do not work above cloud level.

### Potato Poem

Players can view the Potato Poem by reaching y=-64. See the [wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_24w14potato#Trivia) for a transcript of the Potato Poem.

When a player is done reading the Potato Poem, they are returned to their spawn point, launched into the air, and are equipped with Poisonous Pota-toes. The Poisonous Pota-toes completely **replace** any item in the boots slot.

## Biomes

All mobs are spawned under their normal mob caps.

Common mob spawns in the below table are shared between all biomes except Wasteland:

| Mob                     | Weight | Pack Size |

### Corruption

Phantoms targeting a player do not set on fire.

| Mob             | Weight | Pack Size |
| --------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Cat\*           | 40     | 1         |

| Witch\**        | 100    | 1         |
| Phantom         | 100    | 1         |
| (common spawns) |        |           |

\* All spawned cats are black cats.

\** Witches can spawn at any light level.

### Fields

| --------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Zombie          | 95     | 4         |
| Zombie Villager | 5      | 1         |
| (common spawns) |        |           |

### Hash

Snow golems melt.

The Hash biome spawns creatures (Sheep, Pigs, Chicken, Cows, and Armadillos) 10Ã— less often than other biomes.

| Mob             | Weight | Pack Size |
| --------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Armadillo       | 4      | 1-2       |
| Husk            | 80     | 4         |
| Zombie          | 19     | 4         |
| Zombie Villager | 1      | 1         |
| (common spawns) |        |           |

### Wasteland

**Water is poisonous**. All mobs in water or rain are given poison for 2 seconds if they do not already have the poison effect.

Snow golems melt.

| Giant\**        | 10     | 1-4       |
| Wither Skeleton | 5      | 1         |
| Toxifin         | 25     | 1-4       |

\* Slimes can spawn anywhere, regardless of height or slime chunks, always spawn as if it was a full moon, and spawn twice as often as slimes in swamps under the same conditions.

\*\* Giants can't actually spawn, since they simultaneously require a light level greater than 11 and less than 8.

### Overworld Biomes

The following mobs were added to overworld mob spawns in all biomes (except Deep Dark):

| Mob                     | Weight | Pack Size |
| ----------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Batato                  | 13     | 8-16      |
| Poisonous Potato Zombie | 25     | 1-4       |

## Ore Generation

Poisonous Potato Ores generate in both the Overworld and Poisonous Potato Dimension, using the same parameters and heights.

Potone Iron, Lapis Lazuli, Redstone, and Diamond ores generate with the same parameters and heights as their stone/deepslate counterparts. Potone Copper and Gold also generate, but instead use the values in the table below:

| **Ore**                | Poisonous Potato |  Amber  |  Copper  |  Gold   |
| ---------------------- |:----------------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| **Veins per Chunk**    |        10        |   20    |    4     |    4    |
| **Max Vein Size**      |        9         |    6    |    10    |    9    |
| **Height Range**       |    -24 to 56     | 0 to 80 | 0 to 112 | 0 to 32 |
| **Most Common Height** |        16        |   40    |    56    |   16    |

Potone gold ore generates 50% as often when exposed to air. All above ores generate using a triangle distribution, with the triangle's peak at the "Most Common Height".

Note that two veins may generate next to each other to form a vein larger than the maximum in the table above, and the most common height may vary depending on terrain and features.

## Structures

Dungeons, Shipwrecks, Potato Mineshafts, and Colosseums can generate anywhere in the Poisonous Potato Dimension.

Potato Villages can generate in the Arboretum, Corruption, and Fields biomes.

Witch huts can generate in the Corruption and Hash biomes.

### Ruined Portatol

Ruined Portatol chests always generate with:
- An Iron Hoe
- 4 rolls of 0-8 bone meal
- 4 rolls from the below table

| Item             | Count | Weight |
| ---------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Potato           | 1-8   | 9      |
| Poisonous Potato | 0-4   | 6      |

Ruined Portatol chests also generate normal Ruined Portal loot, but with the following changes:

| Ruined Portal Item            | Ruined Portatol Item  | Count | Weight |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Golden Apple                  |                       | 1     | 15     |
| Golden Shovel                 |                       | 1     | 15     |
| Golden Pickaxe                |                       | 1     | 15     |
|                               | Poisonous Pota-toes   | 1     | 15     |
| Light Weighted Pressure Plate | Potato Pressure Plate | 1     | 5      |
| Golden Carrot                 | Potato Fruit          | 4-12  | 5      |
| Gold Ingot                    |                       | 2-8   | 5      |
|                               | Potato Oil            | 1     | 5      |

### Colosseum

The world is split into 24Ã—24 chunk squares, and a colosseum is placed in a random position within each square (unless generation fails). Trial chambers are at least 5 chunks away from each other in each x and z directions and at most 43 chunks away.

Most water blocks are actually waterlogged light blocks. Beneath the water, a 1-block high maze generates, leading to four toxifin spawners under the central platform.

One mega spud, and many toxifins and plaguewhales generate with the structure.

Inside a colosseum, these mobs spawn instead of normal mob spawns:

| Mob      | Weight | Pack Size |
| -------- | ------ | --------- |
| Toxifin  | 1      | 2-4       |
| Spider   | 1      | 1         |
| Skeleton | 1      | 1         |
| Slime    | 1      | 1         |

### Dungeon

Some items in dungeon chests were replaced:

| Old Item       | New Item             | Weight |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| Bread          | Potato Fruit         | 20     |
| Wheat          | Baked Potato         | 20     |
| Redstone       | Poisonous Potato Oil | 15     |

| Melon Seeds    | Poisonous Potato     | 10     |
| Beetroot Seeds | Potato Oil           | 10     |
| Gunpowder      | Bone Meal            | 10     |

### Village

Village house chests have 3-8 rolls of the following loot:

| Item                 | Count | Weight |
| -------------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Potato Oil           | 1-3   | 1      |
| Potato Flower        | 1     | 2      |
| Poisonous Potato Oil | 1     | 1      |

| Bread                | 1-4   | 10     |
| Potato Fruit         | 1-5   | 10     |
| Book                 | 1     | 1      |
| Feather              | 1     | 1      |
| Poisonous Potato     | 1-4   | 2      |
| Potato Sprouts       | 1-2   | 5      |

### Shipwreck

An item was added to the shipwreck supply loot table:

| Item                   | Count | Weight |
| ---------------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Poisonous Potato Plant | 1-2   | 3      |

### Stronghold

A pedestal was added to the portal room.

## Entities

| ID                        | Name                    | Width      | Height     | Eye Height   |

| `batato`                  | Batato                  | 0.5        | 0.9        | 0.45         |
| `eye_of_potato`           | Eye of Potato           | 0.25       | 0.25       | 0.2125       |
| `grid_carrier`            | Super Extra Magic       | 0          | 0          | 0            |

### Potato Variants

Several mobs have potato variants that change the mob's appearance:

- Armadillo
- Chicken
- Bee
- Cow
- Creeper
- Enderman
- Pig
- Sheep
- Skeleton
- Spider
- Husk
- Giant
- Bogged
- Mooshroom
- Stray

The mobs above always appear normal when in the overworld, and appear as their potato variants when in the poisonous potato dimension. Sending a mob to a different dimension makes the mob appear as that dimension's variant.

Potato Sheep are sheared with a Potato Peeler instead of Shears. Shearing them drops 1-3 Potato Peels of the same color as the sheep.

Villagers and zombie villagers do not have a potato variant that functions like the other variants, but they do have unique textures for Potato Villages, similar to the unique textures for villages in other biomes.

Zombies and Poisonous Potato Zombies are not variants of each other, but completely separate entities. Zombies can exist in the poisonous potato dimension, and Poisonous Potato Zombies can exist in the overworld.

### Poisonous Potato Zombie

Unlike regular zombies, Poisonous Potato Zombies do not attack villagers, iron golems, or turtles, do not trample turtle eggs, and cannot become drowned.

Poisonous Potato Zombies will attack and convert regular zombies, even if the potato zombie is currently attacking a player.

Poisonous Potato Zombies always drop a Poisonous Potato. If killed by a player, they drop 5 XP, have a 1/3 chance to drop a Poisonous Potato Plant, and can drop a Poisonous Potato Headpiece with the following chances based on looting:

| Looting     | Chance |
| ----------- | ------ |
| No Looting  | 0.833% |
| Looting I   | 1.167% |
| Looting II  | 1.500% |
| Looting III | 1.833% |

### Batato

A Batato has a 50% chance to drop a Poisonous Potato, and a 5% chance to drop a Venomous Potato.

If a Batato is killed by a player, it has a 1/3 chance to drop a Poisonous Potato Plant.

### Toxifin and Plaguewhale Slabs

Toxifin and Plaguewhale Slabs have the same health and other attributes as Guardians and Elder Guardians, respectively. Toxifin Slabs have 30 health and Plaguewhale Slabs have 80 health.

Toxifin and Plaguewhale Slabs that jump on each other start riding each other, forming a stack of up to 3 mobs. Only Toxifins can stack on Toxifins and only Plaguewhales can stack on Plaguewhales. If one of the mobs is damaged, it is removed from the stack.

Both mobs use an attack similar to a Guardian laser, except they inflict status effects instead of dealing damage directly. Mobs tracked by a charging laser are given 2 seconds of poison (if the mob doesn't already have poison). When the laser charges completely, it gives the wither effect based on the below table:

| Mob                  | Easy/Normal | Hard        |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Toxifin Slab**     | 2.5 seconds | 3.5 seconds |
| **Plaguewhale Slab** | 3.5 seconds | 4.5 seconds |

Both mobs give the wither effect for 2 seconds when hit with spikes extended.

#### Drops

Toxifins have a chance to drop a Toxic Resin with Clouded clarity and Fishy impurities:

| Count       | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | Average |
| ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- |
| No Looting  | 1/2 | 1/2 |     |     |     | 0.5     |
| Looting I   | 1/4 | 1/2 | 1/4 |     |     | 1       |
| Looting II  | 1/6 | 1/3 | 1/3 | 1/6 |     | 1.5     |
| Looting III | 1/8 | 1/4 | 1/4 | 1/4 | 1/8 | 2       |

Toxifins have a chance to drop a Toxic Resin with Jewel clarity and Fishy impurities:

| Count       | 0       | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4   | Average |

### Mega Spud

A Mega Spud has **1024 health and 5 armor points**. Its natural armor protects against 4-20% of damage, at a minimum of 4% if the incoming attack does 8 damage or more. If all attacks do 8+ damage, Mega Spud has 1067 effective health. Mega Spud will only take a maximum of **100 damage** at once.

Mega Spud drops **50 XP** and a Potato Staff on death.

Unlike other boss mobs, Mega Spud is not immune to any type of damage or status effects.

Mega Spud attacks by colliding with the player, dealing 1 damage, and by shooting Ghast fireballs every 3 seconds. It will attack players, iron golems, and villagers.

Mega Spud has a `generic.movement_speed` attribute of 0.2 and a `generic.jump_strength` attribute of 0.62. Mega Spud can follow targets up to 48 blocks away.

Mega Spud can ride in a minecart at any size, and can ride in a boat when small enough. A fishing rod can pull Mega Spud.

Mega Spud sets its "home" to its spawn location when it is first spawned. The home is where the boss and its minions are restricted to, and where minions will spawn from. Mega Spud updates its home to its current position when the Mega Spud is 128 blocks away from its old home, or the Mega Spud is at the `(0, 0, 0)` block.

If Mega Spud changes dimensions, its home is at the same **exact** coordinates in the new dimension, even if going to the Nether. For example, if Mega Spud's home is at `(200, 32, 150)` in the potato dimension, then the Mega Spud goes through a nether portal, then its home will still be `(200, 32, 150)` in the Nether.

#### Phases

The Mega Spud fight is divided into **10 phases**, plus the initial phase. When each phase's health threshold is reached, Mega Spud shrinks by 0.52 blocks, creates a shield around itself, and starts spawning minions.

\* Mega Spud starts at phase 0, and immediately transitions to phase 1 after taking any damage.

\*\* Mega Spud does not shrink during the last phase.

When a new phase begins, one minion spawns immediately, then there is a 5% chance each tick to spawn another minion until all are summoned. Minions spawn at Mega Spud's home, with an offset from -4 to 4 in the x and z directions with a triangle distribution, and an offset from 0 to 4 in the y direction with a uniform distribution. Effectively, minions can spawn within a **8Ã—4Ã—8 box** around Mega Spud's home, and locations closer to the center are more likely.

Mega Spud's shield protects it against **all** forms of damage (except void and `/kill`). Any damage taken is reflected back to the attacker, excluding thorns. The reflected damage becomes "potato magic" damage, which can be reduced by Resistance, Protection, and Projectile Protection.

If a player damages Mega Spud while its shield is up, all minions glow for 10 seconds.

After all minions are defeated or unloaded, Mega Spud loses its shield.

If Mega Spud is killed or unloaded, all minions are killed or removed, respectively. If Mega Spud had active minions, unloading and loading Mega Spud will cause those minions to immediately be summoned again.

When a new phase begins, Mega Spud will drop one corrupted potato peel, then will also try 100 times to drop a corrupted potato peel with the following probability:

$$ 0.000140608 \cdot (\text{size})^3 $$

### Villagers

All villagers now buy amber gems instead of emeralds, and sell poisonous potatoes instead of emeralds.

Potato Fishermen Villagers sell Bamboo Rafts.

If the "Villager Trade Rebalance" experiment is enabled, Potato Villagers have the same experimental trades as Plains Villagers.

Wandering Traders now sell Gravtater blocks instead of sand.

### Giant

Giants now do 10 damage on easy, 20 damage on medium, and **30 damage** on hard. Giants have a `generic.attack_knockback` attribute of 50.

### Others

Parrots can imitate Toxifin and Plaguewhale Slabs.

Sheep can eat Peelgrass and Corrupted Peelgrass to turn the block into Terre de Pomme. Eating Corrupted Peelgrass gives the sheep poison for 1 second.

\* The Potato Refinery block requires the correct tool to drop as an item, but it has no assigned tool.

Fletching Tables can no longer be moved by pistons because they are now a block entity.

Some blocks have additional properties:

| Block                       | Light Level  | Conducts Redstone? | Valid Spawn?          |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | --------------------- |

\* Some blocks that are valid spawns may never have mobs spawn on top of them due to light level requirements.

Some blocks are part of block families which share properties:

| Block Family        | Similar To         |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Potone              | Stone              |
| Taterstone          | Cobblestone        |
| Terre de Pomme      | Dirt               |
| Peelgrass           | Grass              |
| Corrupted Peelgrass | Nylium             |
| Gravtater           | Sand               |
| Potato Wood         | Non-flammable Wood |

### Potato Crop

Potatoes grow **4 times faster** than usual. Potatoes planted on corrupted peelgrass do not require moisture.

Regular potatoes drop as normal when the crop is fully grown. At any age, there is a 2% chance to drop a regular potato, and a **2% chance to drop a Venomous Potato.**

Potatoes have a different chance of dropping poisonous potatoes based on what block they're growing from:

| Supporting Block                         | Drops                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Farmland<br>Poison Farmland<br>Gravtater | 2% chance to drop Poisonous Potato<br>1% chance to drop Poisonous Potato Plant |
| Peelgrass                                | 10% chance to drop Poisonous Potato                                            |
| Corrupted Peelgrass                      | 16.667% chance to drop Poisonous Potato                                        |

### Farmland Blocks

Using a hoe on the following blocks creates Poison Farmland:
- Peelgrass
- Corrupted Peelgrass
- Terre de Pomme
- Poison Path

Poison Farmland functions the exact same as regular farmland.

If either farmland is converted to dirt in the potato dimension, it will instead convert to Terre de Pomme. Farmland blocks with no crops will not naturally decay into Terre de Pomme in the potato dimension.

### Path Blocks

Using a shovel on the following blocks creates a Poison Path block:
- Peelgrass
- Corrupted Peelgrass
- Terre de Pomme

If either path block is converted to dirt in the potato dimension, it will instead convert to Terre de Pomme.

### Grass and Mycelium

If a grass or mycelium block converts to dirt or spreads dirt in the potato dimension, it will instead convert to Terre de Pomme.

### Potato Plants

Unlike deepslate, potato buds can only be placed on:
- Peelgrass
- Corrupted Peelgrass
- Terre de Pomme
- Gravtater
- Any Potato Peels Block

Potato buds have a 20% chance instead of a 1.138% chance to grow when the base is random ticked.

Potato sprouts have a **25% chance** to grow into a potato tree when bonemealed. Potato sprouts do not grow on their own.

The following items can be used in a composter:

| Item            | Compost Chance |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Potato Leaves   | 30%            |
| Potato Stem     | 30%            |
| Potato Bud      | 30%            |
| Potato Sprouts  | 30%            |
| Potato Fruit    | 30%            |
| Potato Pedicule | 30%            |
| Hot Potato      | 85%            |
| Potato Flower   | 85%            |
| Potato Staff    | 100%           |

### Ores

Both Poisonous Potato Ore and Resin Ore drop items with the following distribution:

| Count       | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | Average |
| ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- |
| No Fortune  | 1   |     |     |     | 1       |
| Fortune I   | 2/3 | 1/3 |     |     | 1.33    |
| Fortune II  | 2/4 | 1/4 | 1/4 |     | 1.75    |
| Fortune III | 2/5 | 1/5 | 1/5 | 1/5 | 2.2     |

Poisonous Potato Ore blocks have an additional **5% chance** to drop a Poisonous Potato Plant.

Resin Ore drops 0-1 XP. All Toxic Resin drops with the same clarity and impurities, chosen randomly from the table below:

| Clarity  | Impurities | Chance |
| -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Abysmal  | Air Bubble | 4/9    |
| Clouded  | Air Bubble | 3/9    |
| Eventual | Air Bubble | 2/9    |

Potone versions of existing ores drop as usual.

### Potato Refinery

The Potato Refinery functions similarly to a furnace. It takes the same fuel items as a furnace and burns through fuel at the same rate.

| Left Ingredient  | Right Ingredient | Result               | XP  | Time         |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | --- | ------------ |
| Potato           | Glass Bottle     | Potato Oil           | 0.1 | 5 seconds    |
| Poisonous Potato | Glass Bottle     | Poisonous Potato Oil | 0.1 | 6.25 seconds |
| Potato Oil       | (any item)       | (lubricated item)    | 0   | 1 second     |

A comparator gives the following outputs. Note that the item counts are based off a stack size of 64.

| Signal Strength | Items |
| ---------------:| ----- |
|               0 | 0     |
|               1 | 1     |
|               2 | 19    |
|               3 | 37    |
|               4 | 55    |
|               5 | 1s10  |
|               6 | 1s28  |
|               7 | 1s46  |
|               8 | 2s    |
|               9 | 2s19  |
|              10 | 2s37  |
|              11 | 2s55  |
|              12 | 3s10  |
|              13 | 3s28  |
|              14 | 3s46  |
|              15 | 4s    |

#### Lubrication

Lubricating an item increases its lubrication factor and causes it to slide on the ground with less friction. The same item can be lubricated multiple times.

$$ \text{lubricationFactor} = 1 - \frac{1}{6} \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^\text{level} $$

$$ \text{friction} = 1 - (1 - \text{blockFriction}) \cdot (1 - \text{lubricationFactor}) $$

| Level | Lubrication Factor |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| 0     | 0                  |
| 1     | 0.875              |
| 2     | 0.90625            |
| 3     | 0.9296875          |
| 4     | 0.9472656          |
| 5     | 0.9604492          |
| 6     | 0.9703369          |
| 7     | 0.9777527          |
| 8     | 0.9833145          |
| 9     | 0.9874859          |
| 10    | 0.9906144          |

An item that was lubricated **55** or more times has a lubrication factor of 1 due to floating-point precision.

### Poisonous Potato Cutter

A Poisonous Potato Cutter can cut Poisonous Potatoes into Poisonous Potato Slices or Poisonous Potato Sticks in a similar interface to a stonecutter.

### Fletching Table

The Fletching Table is now functional. Fletching Tables refine specific Toxic Resin into different Toxic Resin, as described by the Fletching Table's title:

> Fletching `<quality>` Clarity, `<impurities>` Impurities into `<new quality>` Clarity, `<new impurities>` Impurities

`<quality>`, `<impurities>`, and `<new impurities>` are **randomized** when the Fletching Table is placed. There is a **1/160** chance to get a specific input quality and impurities, and a 1/2560 chance to get a specific input quality, input impurities, and output impurities.

`<new impurities>` shows `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯` until the table processes its first Toxic Resin.

`<new quality>` is always the "next" quality alphabetically after `<quality>`. If `<quality>` is "Jewel", then the Fletching Table instead outputs Amber Gems and displays the following title:

> Fletching Jewel Clarity, `<impurities>` Impurities into Amber Gem

When a feather is placed in the leftmost slot and a matching Toxic Resin is placed in the input slot, the Toxic Resin is processed into the output item. The feather is not consumed. The processing time is **randomized** when the Fletching Table is placed.

Comparators output a signal based on a 3-slot inventory. Although the feather slot only allows one item, comparators read as if the slot allowed 64 items. As a result, comparators can only output up to 10 signal strength.

| Signal Strength | Items |
| ---------------:| ----- |
|               0 | 0     |
|               1 | 1     |
|               2 | 14    |
|               3 | 28    |
|               4 | 42    |
|               5 | 55    |
|               6 | 1s5   |
|               7 | 1s19  |
|               8 | 1s32  |
|               9 | 1s46  |
|              10 | 1s60  |

Note that the item counts are based off a stack size of 64.

### Frying Table

A Frying Table can cook Potatoes into Baked Potatoes and Potato Peels of any color into Hash Browns, similar to a campfire. Unlike a campfire, frying tables do not do damage and do not give off light.

### Block of Amber

Blocks of Amber can be used in beacons.

### Pedestal

Using a poisonous potato on a pedestal creates a Potato Portal if the block above the pedestal can be replaced.

Mining a pedestal drops nothing.

### Potato Portal

Portal mechanics are the same as nether portal mechanics.

### Mashed Potatoes

Mashed Potatoes can be layered like snow, but **only drop 1 item** regardless of how many layers were mined.

Entities can walk through mashed potatoes, but are slowed down like in powder snow. Entities are given the Sticky effect for 5 seconds, plus 1 second per layer up to 8 layers, for a maximum of 13 seconds.

### Corrupted Potato Peels Block

A Corrupted Potato Peels Block has a 5% chance to spawn a random entity on top of the block when random ticked:

| Entity                  | Chance |
| ----------------------- | ------ |
| Enderman                | 50%    |
| Poisonous Potato Zombie | 40%    |
| Item (Poisonous Potato) | 8%     |
| Batato                  | 1.9%   |
| Ghast\*                 | 0.1%   |

\* Ghasts are spawned 2 blocks upward due to their large size.

If any living entities are in the block above the Corrupted Potato Peels Block, nothing will spawn.

A Corrupted Potato Peels Block has a 0.2% chance each tick to play the Witch ambient sound.

### Poisonous Potato Zombie Headpiece

A Poisonous Potato Zombie Headpiece can be worn as a helmet, disguising the player as a Poisonous Potato Zombie, similar to how a Zombie Head disguises the player as a Zombie. Dispensers can equip the headpiece.

### Big Brain

Every 5 ticks, the block causes all experience orbs within a **10Ã—10Ã—10 cube** to target the Big Brain. The Big Brain absorbs XP until it reaches **1000 XP**, then it drops a Potato of Knowledge containing the 1000 XP.

### Powerful Potato and Strong Roots

The Powerful Potato grows roots downwards, harvesting blocks and depositing their loot at the top.

When a Powerful Potato is random ticked, it tries to grow Strong Roots downwards or to the sides. If successful, its `age` block state increases by 1. Once `age` reaches 3, it will not grow Strong Roots anymore.

When a Strong Roots block is random ticked, it also tries to grow more Strong Roots. It will not grow if it is directly connected to 4 or more blocks.

Strong Roots grow similarly to Chorus Plants. When growing Strong Roots, there is a 10/14 chance to try to place the block downwards, and a 1/14 chance each of trying to place the block to the north, east, south, or west. Strong Roots can grow into and replace any block, except a Powerful Potato, other Strong Roots, and any block in the `#features_cannot_replace` tag. Similarly to Chorus Plants, Strong Roots will not grow into a space where it would be connected to a different Strong Roots block (the "branches" of the "tree" stay separate).

When a Strong Roots block grows and replaces another block, the block's loot is deposited at the top of the Powerful Potato. The loot is determined by "mining" the block with a simulated Netherite Pickaxe, with a chance to have the following enchantments:

| Enchantments | Chance |
| ------------ | ------ |
| None         | 60%    |
| Silk Touch   | 20%    |
| Fortune III  | 20%    |

### Weak Roots

Weak Roots have the same block structure and data as Strong Roots, but they do not spread. A `WeakRootsBlock` class is in the code but unused, so this behavior was probably a mistake.

### Vicious Potato

A Vicious Potato shoots projectiles at living entities within a **16Ã—16Ã—16 box** centered on the block. Line of sight is not required. The projectile is aimed at the center of the target's bounding box and has no inaccuracy.

The projectile (`vine_projectile`) travels at **10 blocks per second**, lasts **3 seconds**, and collides with entities and blocks. Damage varies, but it counts as "potato magic" damage, which can be reduced by Resistance, Protection, and Projectile Protection. Entities killed by the projectile always drop XP.

When a Vicious Potato is powered by redstone, it tries to attack with a projectile that does **5 damage**. If there was an enemy close enough to attack, the block schedules a tick 20-119 game ticks in the future.

When the block is ticked by a scheduled tick, it chooses a random attack damage from 0-0.7. The Vicious Potato then shoots a projectile with that attack damage. Then, there is an 83.667% chance to schedule another tick 20-90 game ticks in the future, with shorter delays more likely than longer delays.

Note that the particles from the projectiles can easily lag the game. Change the particles setting to "Minimal" before powering Vicious Potatoes on a clock.

### Potato Battery

Right-clicking a Potato Battery will invert it. An inverted battery gives a signal strength of **15**, and a normal battery gives no signal.

Entities standing on an inverted Potato Battery will be damaged by 0.5 "potato magic" damage every tick, though damage invulnerability greatly reduces the potential damage output. The damage can be reduced by Resistance, Protection, and Projectile Protection. Mobs killed by reflected damage always drop XP.

Mobs killed by a Potato Battery always drop XP.

### Floatato

Floatato blocks can be placed mid-air, **3 blocks** from the player's eye position.

### Floatater

The Floatater block is a redstone component that can move large amounts of blocks smoothly.

When placed by a player, **it does not check if it was powered**, and will only activate after a block update.

When the block is powered, it **immediately** updates its `triggered` state, which can be read by an observer. **After a 1 game tick delay**, the Floatater scans for blocks that can be moved. If the Floatater is able to move blocks, those blocks are removed from the world without causing block updates, added to a `grid_carrier` entity, and start moving.

Any block entities part of the Floatater structure are **broken** instead of moving. Any blocks that were connected to the block entities will still move.

Fluids are not deleted from the world when moved, so "moving" a water or lava block will leave water at the old location and place water at the new location. Moving a waterlogged block leaves water at the old location and moves the block without water.

#### Block Scanning

When the Floatater scans for blocks that can be moved, it starts at the powered Floatater, then connects adjacent blocks to the structure until no more blocks can be connected. If the structure expands past a **32Ã—32Ã—32 cube** (or higher if changed by the `floataterSizeLimit` gamerule), it will not move.

Two blocks are connected to each other if:
- One of them is sticky
	- Slime and Honey blocks are sticky on all sides
	- Sticky pistons and Floataters are **only sticky on one side**
	- Sticky blocks stick to **everything**, including air
	- Represented by __green lines__ in the image below
- The two blocks have interaction boxes that touch
	- For example, chain blocks connect to full blocks from their two ends, but not from any other direction
	- **Excludes Floataters** on non-sticky sides (so a Floatater doesn't try to move any redstone components used to power it)
	- Represented by __blue lines__ in the image below
- One block is "in front of" the other and would be pushed by the other
	- Air blocks that are "connected to" a sticky block can "push" other blocks
	- Represented by __yellow arrows__ in the image below

The image below demonstrates how Floatater mechanics work. Green blocks will move, while red blocks will not. Any blocks that are not green or red will only move if they are connected by yellow, green, or blue lines.

#### Movement

Moving blocks do not have scheduled or random ticks. The only exception is Floatater blocks, which only process animations each tick. Moving blocks cannot be updated and do not give block updates to their surroundings.

Moving blocks only interact with other entities through collision. Pistons cannot push them, and TNT cannot destroy them. Players cannot place, break, or interact with moving blocks.

Any blocks with block entities added to the `grid_carrier` entity through commands are moved without their block entity data.

A Floatater moves blocks until any block reaches the world ceiling, the world floor, or any non-replaceable block. They do not stop at the world border.

When a Floatater hits a block, all moving blocks are placed in the world, causing block updates. The `grid_carrier` entity containing the blocks is removed 1 game tick later.

Floataters move blocks at 0.1 blocks per game tick (2 blocks per second) per Floatater. Only **powered** Floataters in the **same direction** increase movement speed.

If a Floatater is 0-ticked, it is powered and unpowered within the same game tick, and it scans for blocks 1 game tick later. However, the Floatater is unpowered at that time, so there are 0 powered floataters and therefore it moves at 0 blocks per game tick. As a failsafe, whenever the `grid_carrier` entity's movement speed is 0, it places its block on the next game tick.

#### NBT Format

All blocks for each local coordinate from `(0, 0, 0)` to `(size_x - 1, size_y - 1, size_z - 1)` are stored in a flattened 3D array, `blocks`. Rather than storing each block multiple times, `blocks` instead contains indexes into the `palette` list, which contains each unique block state. The process is best described by the Java code below:

```java
BlockState getBlockState(int x, int y, int z) {
    // Convert coordinate to index into flattened 3D array
    int indexIntoBlocks = (x + z * sizeX) * sizeY + y;
    // `blocks` stores indexes into the palette list
    int indexIntoPalette = blocks[indexIntoBlocks];
    // If there is no block at that coordinate, -1 is stored instead
    if (indexIntoPalette == -1) {
        return AIR;
    }
    // Get the block state associated with the input coordinate
    return palette.get(indexIntoPalette);
}
```

All tickable blocks (only Floatater blocks) have their coordinates stored in the `tickables` array. Coordinates are encoded into long integers using the following Java code:

```java
long asLong(int x, int y, int z) {
    long l = 0L;
    l |= ((long) x & 0x03FF_FFFF) << 38;
    l |= ((long) y & 0x0FFF) << 0;
    l |= ((long) z & 0x03FF_FFFF) << 12;
    return l;
}
```

`grid_carrier` has the following NBT data:

- Compound `blocks` - The collection of blocks moved by the entity
	- Integer `size_x` - The size of the bounding box containing all moving blocks
	- Integer `size_y` - The size of the bounding box containing all moving blocks
	- Integer `size_z` - The size of the bounding box containing all moving blocks
	- List `palette` - A list of unique block states referenced by the `blocks` array
	- Int Array `blocks` - An array of indexes into the `palette` list, used to look up a block state for a given local coordinate. If there is no block at the given coordinate, -1 is stored instead.
	- Long Array `tickables` - An array of coordinates of blocks that tick while flying
- String `biome` - The biome used to inform block rendering, set to the activated Floatater's biome
- String `movement_direction` - The direction the blocks move, one of "up", "down", "north", "east", "south", "west"
- Float `movement_speed` - The movement speed in blocks per tick

## Enchantments

A new enchantment was added, **Potatofication**. It can be applied to pickaxes, axes, shovels, hoes, and shears.

| Level | Weight | Treasure | Can be found in normal loot |
| ----- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------- |
| 1-5   | 10     | No       | Yes                         |

After the enchanting table calculates the [modified enchantment level](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanting_mechanics#How_enchantments_are_chosen), it uses the below table to determine which enchantments are possible for a given modified enchantment level:

| Enchantment Level          | I    | II    | III   | IV    | V     |
| -------------------------- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Modified Enchantment Level | 1-16 | 11-26 | 21-36 | 31-46 | 41-56 |

When a tool with Potatofication breaks a block, the block additionally drops potatoes and/or poisonous potatoes. If the block is not mineable by the tool, no items will drop.

To calculate what items are dropped, a random amount of regular potatoes `r` is selected from 0 to `level`. Then, the amount of poisonous potatoes is determined by `p = level - r`. Once the two numbers are selected, `r^2` regular potatoes are dropped and `p^2` poisonous potatoes are dropped.

The average amount of regular potatoes and the average amount of poisonous potatoes dropped per level `L` are both:

$$ \frac{L(2L + 1)}{6} $$

The average and maximum amounts of potatoes and poisonous potatoes per level are both summarized in the table below. These are the values for **either** regular potatoes or poisonous potatoes, not the combined drops. Simply multiply by 2 to get the average and max values for the combined drops.

| Level              | Average | Max |
| ------------------ | ------- | --- |
| Potatofication I   | 0.5     | 1   |
| Potatofication II  | 1.667   | 4   |
| Potatofication III | 3.5     | 9   |
| Potatofication IV  | 6       | 16  |
| Potatofication V   | 9.167   | 25  |

Additionally, there is a **5% chance** to drop a Poisonous Potato Plant regardless of enchantment level.

## Status Effects

Two status effects were added:

| ID           | Name               |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| `potato_oil` | It's very slippery |
| `sticky`     | Sticky             |

"It's very slippery" does nothing.

The Sticky effect allows entities to **climb walls** as if they were a spider, and spawn footprint particles if not in a liquid.

## Items

Some items have unusual stack sizes and rarities:

| Item                              | Stack Size | Rarity   | Durability |

\* The Potato of Knowledge is a common item, but it has an enchantment glint override.

"Potato" is a new rarity exclusive to this snapshot.

\*** `snektato` appears as a regular potato until the player tries to eat it, then it changes its name and texture to "Venomous Potato". It is not a real food, and therefore not required for the "A Balanced Diet" advancement.

### Potions

The two new status effects have potion, splash potion, lingering potion, and tipped arrow items:

| Item                           | Effects                                      |

### Potato Peels

Right-clicking the top of Terre de Pomme with a Lime Potato Peel turns it into Peelgrass, and right-clicking the top of Terre de Pomme with a Corrupted Potato Peel turns it into Corrupted Peelgrass.

### Hot Potato

Throwing any item in the `#heatable_potatos` \[sic\] (potato, baked potato, poisonous potato) into lava will turn it into a Hot Potato. Hot Potatoes bounce randomly in lava.

Hot Potatoes in a player's inventory increment their `inventory_heat` timer every tick, up to a maximum of **200 ticks** (10 seconds). The player takes damage depending on how long the Pot Potato is held. Note that damage invulnerability greatly reduces the potential damage output.

| Ticks Held | Damage Taken |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| 0-20       | 0            |
| 21-64      | 1            |
| 65-109     | 2            |
| 110-154    | 3            |

If the Hot Potato is not in any inventory slot, but is "picked up" by moving it with the mouse, then it does not do damage. The survival 2Ã—2 crafting grid counts as the player's inventory, but the 3Ã—3 crafting table menu and any containers do not count.

Placing the Hot Potato in a different slot, including by switching between main hand and off hand, **resets the timer.**

### Lashing Potato

The Lashing Potato shoots a hook where the player is looking, travelling at 5 blocks per second. The hook is shot from 0.1 blocks below the player's eye position. The hook retracts when it travels 100 blocks.

While the player is swinging with the Lashing Potato, the player takes no fall damage and has much less air friction.

### Potato Hammer

The Potato Hammer does **11 damage**, has 6 attack speed (which is faster than the player's usual attack speed of 4!), and is enchanted with Knockback X. It does not have durability.

Hitting an entity with the Potato Hammer has a **30% chance** to shoot a lingering potion that inflicts Poison for 22.5 seconds.

### Potato Peeler

The Potato Peeler does 2 damage, **12 damage against potato mobs**, and has 5 attack speed. All potato variants of mobs, Batato, Poisonous Potato Zombies, and Mega Spud count as potato mobs. Toxifin and Plaguewhale Slabs are **not** potato mobs.

Right-clicking a block with a Potato Peeler drops some items and converts that block into a different block:

| Block                                      | Drops                          | Converted To       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| All Potato Peels Blocks (except corrupted) | 9 Potato Peels with same color | Air                |
| Peelgrass Block (top face)                 | 1 Lime Potato Peel             | Terre de Pomme     |
| Corrupted Peelgrass Block (top face)       | 1 Corrupted Potato Peel        | Terre de Pomme     |
| Poisonous Potato Block                     | 9 Poisonous Potatoes           | Potato Peels Block |

Killing a mob with a Potato Peeler also drops a Potato Peel of a specific color:

| Mob      | Peel Color                  |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| Bee      | Yellow or Black (at random) |
| Bogged   | Cyan                        |
| Chicken  | Regular                     |
| Cow      | Brown                       |
| Creeper  | Green                       |
| Enderman | Black                       |
| Pig      | Pink                        |
| Skeleton | Light Gray                  |
| Spider   | Gray                        |
| Stray    | Light Blue                  |
| Sheep    | (wool color)                |

Right-clicking a Potato Sheep with a Potato Peeler shears it.

Right-clicking an entity (including an Armor Stand) with a Poisonous Potato Chestplate breaks the chestplate and drops a Potato Peel.

### Potato Staff

The Potato Staff's full name is "Potatiesh, Greatstaff of the Peasant".

Right-clicking a block places a Potato Portal if there is space. If a player in Survival or Adventure mode tries to place a portal without completing the Non Plus Ultra advancement, a fiery explosion with radius 5 (power 10) will occur at the player's position, and the following message will display:

> `<username>` was unworthy of Potatiesh, Greatstaff of the Peasant

The staff does not explode when the player composts it.

### Poisonous Potato Chestplate

The Poisonous Potato Chestplate does not protect against any damage. Instead of losing hunger, the player can "eat" the chestplate, taking **40 durability**.

### Poisonous Pota-toes

The Poisonous Pota-toes are boots that only protect against fall damage. If a fall would cause the player to take damage, then the boots break, and several mashed potato blocks are spread around the player.

A mashed potato layer is always placed at the player's position. The game attempts to place mashed potato layers 1-80 times depending on how far the player fell. Note that `safeFallDistance` defaults to 3 and can be changed by the `generic.safe_fall_distance` attribute.

$$ \text{attemptCount} = 1 + \frac{79}{50}(\text{fallDistance} - \text{safeFallDistance}) $$

For each attempt, the game picks a random block within a box centered on the player, depending on the player's fall distance. The box's size varies based on the table below. The x and z coordinates are chosen uniformly, but there is a 50% chance to choose the same height as the player, and a 25% chance each to choose a block above or below the player.

| Box   | Fall Distance             |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| 1Ã—3Ã—1 | 0                         |
| 2Ã—3Ã—2 | 12.5 + `safeFallDistance` |
| 3Ã—3Ã—3 | 25 + `safeFallDistance`   |
| 4Ã—3Ã—4 | 37.5 + `safeFallDistance` |
| 5Ã—3Ã—5 | 50 + `safeFallDistance`   |

For each attempt, the game will try to add a mashed potato layer at the chosen location, using the same placement mechanics as snow layers.

### Amber Gem

Amber gems can be used to activate beacons.

Amber gems are an armor trim material.

### Toxic Resin

Smelting Poisonous Potato Oil creates Toxic Resin with Abysmal clarity and **random** impurities.

Toxic Resin can have any of the following clarities and impurities:

| Clarity    | Impurities | Quality (unused) |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Abysmal    | Air Bubble | Opaque           |
| Blemished  | Bug        | Murky            |
| Clouded    | Chemical   | Cloudy           |
| Dull       | Diorite    | Clear            |
| Eventual   | Ender      | Pure             |
| Faint      | Fishy      | Flawless         |
| Glimmering | Galactic   | Perfect          |
| Hazy       | Honey      | Transcendent     |
| Icy        | Insect     | Divine           |
| Jewel      | Jinn       | Ethereal         |
|            | Kraken     | Celestial        |
|            | Lunar      |                  |
|            | Metallic   |                  |
|            | Nether     |                  |
|            | Organic    |                  |
|            | Pigment    |                  |

A comment was left by a [certain Mojang employee](https://www.youtube.com/@gnembon) in the language files talking about the unused quality strings:

> These are nice, but I can't find a use for them \[G\]. Leave a like, leave a comment, and subscribe!, and see you in the next one, bye!

## Death Messages

When a player dies from Hot Potato damage:

> `<victim>` held the hot potato for too long.

When a player dies due to standing on a Potato Battery, a projectile from a Vicious Potato, or reflected damage from Mega Spud:

> `<victim>` was killed by a bad-tempered potato

## Gamerules

The `floataterSizeLimit` gamerule controls the width of the cube describing the maximum volume a Floatater can push at once (including the Floatater). Defaults to 32, meaning a Floatater can push up to a 32Ã—32Ã—32 block cube by default.

The `neverEatArmor` gamerule disables eating a worn Poisonous Potato Chestplate to prevent losing hunger. Defaults to false.

## Splashes

See the [wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_24w14potato#General) for a list of splash texts.

## Misc

Flying anti-cheat is disabled in this snapshot.

A new "Potato" keybind was added, defaults to apostrophe (`'`). Pressing the assigned key will make the player send 1-6 bouncing poisonous potatoes in chat.

The unicode characters `U+D83E` and `U+DD54` render as bouncing poisonous potatoes.

## Particles

Four particles were added: `falling_poison`, `footstep`, `lightning`, and `reverse_lightning`.

## Sounds

The sounds for the new content were added to the `nothingtoseeheremovealong` namespace, not the `minecraft` namespace.

The `nothingtoseeheremovealong:ooof` and `nothingtoseeheremovealong:the_joke` sounds return from [23w13a_or_b](/snapshots/23w13a-or-b), but they are unused.
