This snapshot makes candles, bundles, and sculk sensors command-only, and upgrades Java to Java 16.

# Java 16

This is great news for developers who want to take advantage of Java 16's new features. If you use [DecompilerMC](https://github.com/hube12/DecompilerMC) to look at the source code, make sure to grab the latest version from the master branch.

There aren't any features in this snapshot that need to be reverse engineered. If you want to know how something in Minecraft works, DM me on Discord at `Tis_awesomeness#8617`.
