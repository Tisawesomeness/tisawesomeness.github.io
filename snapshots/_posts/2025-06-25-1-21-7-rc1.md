A surprise "hotfix" release candidate. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-7-release-candidate-1).

## Music Disc

The Lava Chicken music disc can only be dropped by a **regular** baby zombie (not Husks, Drowned, or other variants) which is **currently** riding a chicken. Killing the chicken first, then the baby zombie does not drop the disc.

The music disc plays for 2:14 and has a comparator output of 9.
