The first 1.19.1 snapshot is here, adding player chat reporting.

# Allay

Allays have a **2 minute** duplication cooldown, NOT the 2.5 minutes mentioned in the changelog.

Allays dance if they are within **10 blocks** of a jukebox.

# Game Events

Two new game events were added: `jukebox_play` and `jukebox_stop_play`. The warden can listen to both of these events.

# Chat Reporting

Chat reports send:

- A report UUID
- The report type (always "chat")
- Opinion comments
- Reason
- List of chat messages as context:
  - The author's UUID
  - Timestamp
  - Salt and signature
  - Both signed and unsigned parts of the message
  - A boolean field marking which chat messages are the ones being reported
- Report creation timestamp
- Client version
- If the server is a third party, the server's address
- If the server is a realm, the realm and slot IDs

Clients do an API lookup to determine the max opinion comments length, the max reported message count, and max context message count
