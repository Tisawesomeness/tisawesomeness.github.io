Yet another pre-release with some technical tweaks.

## Iron Golem Spawning

To fix [MC-262340](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-262340), iron golems no longer spawn on top of:

- Glass
- Stained Glass
- Tinted Glass
- Leaves
- Conduit
- Ice
- Frosted Ice
- TNT
- Glowstone
- Beacon
- Sea Lantern

Iron golems can now spawn on top of powder snow.

## Advancements

**Smithing with Style** is now a challenge advancement that rewards no experience.

## Loot Tables

Vanilla loot tables still use random sequences to create deterministic loot.
