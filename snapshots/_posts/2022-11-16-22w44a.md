Another snapshot focusing on quality-of-life changes.

# Changes

Bamboo Mosaic and Bamboo Mosaic Stairs both smelt **1.5 items per block**, the same as bamboo planks. Bamboo Mosaic Slabs smelt half as much: **0.75 items per block**.

Turtles now have a 5 minute breeding delay.

# Tags

Bamboo mosaic blocks are no longer included in `#wooden_slabs` and `#wooden_stairs`.

Removed `#non_flammable_wood` block tag, but it still exists as an item tag.

`#fence_gates` was previously only a block tag, but is now an item tag too. If the 1.20 datapack is enabled, bamboo fence gates are now included.
