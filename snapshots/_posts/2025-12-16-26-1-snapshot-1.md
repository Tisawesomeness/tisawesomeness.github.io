The first 26.1 snapshot is out, featuring data-driven villager trades and other technical changes.

## Versioning

This is the first snapshot with the new [version numbering system](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-new-version-numbering-system).

## Mobs

Piglin inventories use slot indices 300 through 307, like villagers.

Villagers now have a new NBT boolean field: `VillagerDataFinalized`. It is set to true when `VillagerData` is populated, usually on spawn.

## Splashes

Changed "Java 16 + 1 + 4 = 21!" to "Java 16 + 1 + 4 * 2 = 25!".

## GameTest

Added a new command-line argument: `--repeatCount`. It specifies how many times each test will be repeated. The `--verify` argument overrides `--repeatCount`, causing tests to run 100 times in total.
