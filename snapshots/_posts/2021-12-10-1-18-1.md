# Details

There are no changes from 1.18.1-rc3. Mojang has released an [official announcement](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-message--security-vulnerability-java-edition) on the fixed security vulnerability. It is highly recommended that you read the announcement, especially if you run a server, use a custom client, or play on any old version.
