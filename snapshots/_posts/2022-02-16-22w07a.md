Another snapshot for 1.18.2 adds biome customization and some sneaky mob spawning changes.

# Mob Spawning

Glow squids only spawn at light level 0 to fix [MC-238977](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-238977)

Tropical fish will check if the block above is water before spawning to fix [MC-244683](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-244683)

# Debug Menu

Combined Multinoise and Terrain PV into one line in the debug menu named NoiseRouter.
- `T`: temperature
- `H`: humidity
- `C`: continentalness
- `E`: erosion
- `D`: depth (NEW)
- `W`: weirdness
- `PV`: peaks and valleys
- `AS`: initial density no jaggedness (NEW)
- `N`: full noise (NEW)
The `O`, `F`, and `JA` fields that were previously in the Terrain PV line were removed.

# Rooted Dirt

The `azalea_root_replaceable` tag changed from
```
#minecraft:lush_ground_replaceable
#minecraft:terracotta
minecraft:red_sand
minecraft:snow_block
minecraft:powder_snow
```
to
```
#minecraft:base_stone_overworld
#minecraft:dirt
#minecraft:terracotta
minecraft:red_sand
minecraft:clay
minecraft:gravel
minecraft:sand
minecraft:snow_block
minecraft:powder_snow
```
to fix [MC-243190](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-243190)

# Biome Tags

Added the following tags in `worldgen/biome`
```
#is_badlands
#is_beach
#is_deep_ocean
#is_forest
#is_hill
#is_jungle
#is_mountain
#is_nether
#is_ocean
#is_river
#is_tagia
```
Each tag contains a list of biomes.

Each generated structure has a tag in `worldgen/biome/has_structure` containing a list of biomes that structure can generate in.
