The first 1.20.2 pre-release reworks armorer and cartographer villagers.

## Experimental Trade Rebalance

Jungle explorer maps actually lead to jungle temples, and swamp explorer maps actually lead to witch huts.

### Structure Loot

The structure loot changes only apply when the experimental datapack is enabled.

| Structure           | Enchantment  | Chance per Chest |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Abandoned Mineshaft | Efficiency   | 1/5 (20%)        |
| Ancient City        | Mending      | 1/20 (5%)        |
| Desert Temple       | Unbreaking   | 2/7 (28.6%)      |
| Jungle Temple       | Unbreaking   | 1/2 (50%)        |
| Pillager Outpost    | Quick Charge | 2/3 (66.7%)      |

Every level of each enchant has an equal chance of being chosen.

The chance for a randomly enchanted book in desert temples dropped from 20/232 (8.62%) to 10/222 (4.50%) per roll, out of 3 rolls total. To accomodate this, the total weight of all items changed from 232 to 222, slightly increasing the chance of every other item except the dune armor trim. The 2/7 chance for an unbreaking book is chosen from a separate pool and is not affected by these changes.
