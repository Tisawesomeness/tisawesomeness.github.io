# Warden

Wardens now must spawn on blocks that have a top face with full collision.

Wardens can listen to the new `instrument_play` game event for goat horns.

# Misc

Iron golem spawning was reverted to the behavior in 1.18.2.

Tadpoles are now tempted by slimeballs and no longer drop XP.

The British Shorthair cat's ID was renamed from `british` to `british_shorthair`.

Ranged attributes (such as `generic.max_health`) now use the minimum value if the attribute becomes NaN.
