21w43a is out and adds blending of old worlds.

# Upgrading Old Worlds

All bedrock between y=0 and y=4 (hardcoded) is replaced with deepslate, regardless of whether a player placed it or not.

# Item Shadowing Fix

[Item shadowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_FPyn20ns) has been fixed. Now the game clears the player's inventory slot after updating the container, instead of before.
