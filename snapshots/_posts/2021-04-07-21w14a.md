Now you can use fortune on iron, gold, and copper ore! A simple snapshot, but a massive game changer. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-21w14a).

# Fortune

Iron, gold, and copper ores use the same `minecraft:ore_drops` formula as all other ores. So, fortune 3 will drop **1-4 raw ore, 2.2 on average**. See the [wiki page](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Fortune) on Fortune for the calculations, the numbers are the same as diamond.
