As summer vacation ends, Mojang gives us one of the biggest snapshots ever. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w33a).

## Mobs

Mobs can now perform smash attacks with the mace, fixing [MC-269428](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-269428). The attack does the same damage and knockback as when a player performs a smash attack. **The mob does not reset its momentum or accumulated fall distance**, so the mob will take fall damage from the full height of the drop.

Mobs used to search for attackable targets within a 4 block vertical range of the mob's hitbox. The vertical search range was changed to `follow_range` blocks, fixing [MC-121013](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-121013).

### New Variants

| Mob               | Width | Height | Eye Height | Spawn Chance |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| Baby Dolphin      | 0.585 | 0.39   | 0.195      | 5%           |
| Baby (Glow) Squid | 0.4   | 0.4    | 0.2        | 5%           |

| Salmon Size | Spawn Chance    |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| Small       | 3/19 ≈ 15.789%  |
| Medium      | 10/19 ≈ 52.316% |
| Large       | 6/19 ≈ 31.579%  |

Salmon variants currently have the [same hitbox size](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-275222).

### Bees

Bees now wander around randomly for **30 seconds** instead of 2 minutes after exiting a nest/hive. Bees will spend **2 minutes** instead of 30 seconds trying to return home before giving up.

"If a bee has a known nest/hive, it will travel less far from it" is incorrect. Bees now travel up to **24 blocks** from a nest/hive instead of 22 blocks. However, bees are less likely to get lost since they must stray **48 blocks** away from their nest/hive or flower before forgetting, instead of 32 blocks away.

### Breeze

Breezes now remember mobs for **5 seconds** after line of sight is lost, fixing [MC-273076](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-273076).

### Drowned

If a drowned has a trident enchanted with Impaling, Loyalty, or Channeling, those enchantments will now function correctly. Riptide still does not work. Since Drowned do not keep track of item durability, the Unbreaking and Mending enchantments have no effect.

### Zoglin

Zoglins spawned from spawn eggs have a **20% chance** to be a baby.

## Portals

Players stop "using" items (such as holding a shield or eating food) when they switch dimensions, fixing [MC-86252](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-86252) and [MC-274372](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-274372).

An entity cannot go through the end portal if any passenger is a player who has not seen the credits, fixing [MC-272603](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-272603).

## Raids

When the raid wave countdown completes, there are 3 spawn attempt phases with 20 attempts per phase. Each spawn attempt now requires that the spawn position is within a certain vertical distance from the raid center (64 blocks in the first phase, 32 in the second phase, and 0 blocks in the third phase). If the chosen location is outside the vertical range, the spawn attempt fails.

## Trial Chambers

The dispenser activated by tripwire in the parkour over dripstone trap (in `encounter_4.nbt`) is not always an arrow. The dispenser pulls from the usual loot tale.

### Structure Files

The following structure files were modified. Note that `quadrant_1-4.nbt` is shorthand for `quadrant_1.nbt`, `quadrant_2.nbt`, etc. `<color>_bed.nbt` is shorthand for the 16 structure files for each bed color.

```diff

## Misc

Players can no longer fill cauldrons with lava or powder snow if the block above is water or a waterlogged block, fixing [MC-203748](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-203748) and [MC-240948](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-240948). Players can still place water on top of lava or powder snow cauldrons and push cauldrons underwater with pistons.

Experience caps at 2147483647 levels, fixing [MC-3266](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-3266).

Dedicated servers will not pause if a `/tick sprint` is ongoing.

## Redstone Experiment

See [this post](https://gist.github.com/SpaceWalkerRS/25052d03ff956b988c50a75a08619545) by SpaceWalkerRS for a technical breakdown of how the new redstone mechanics work.

Keep in mind that:
- The redstone changes are experimental with no target release version and subject to change
- Other components, such as repeaters, are still directional
- The experiment contains bugs that may complicate testing

## Minecart Experiment

The `minecartMaxSpeed` gamerule ranges from 1 to 1000.

Minecarts no longer snap to rails diagonally. Minecarts snap to the **cardinal direction** closest to the minecart's velocity. The minecart always snaps to 0.1 blocks above if the rail is flat and 0.6 blocks above if the rail is sloped.

Minecarts with no passengers now have a drag coefficient of **0.975** instead of 0.96. Minecarts apply drag linearly every tick.

Minecarts used to pick up entities within a 1.02×1.02 horizontal square (0.02 blocks from the edge of the minecart). Now, minecarts pick up entities that it physically **collides** with.

Players and dispensers cannot place minecarts intersecting the hitbox of another minecart.

Fast-moving hopper minecarts may pull items multiple times per tick, but it can still miss containers at high speeds.

A TNT minecart now only explodes if a collision reduced its horizontal velocity from above 0.1 blocks/tick to below 0.1 blocks/tick.

## Data

### Damage Types

Added two new damage types: `mace_smash` and `ender_pearl`.

Added a new death message for when killed by a mace smash attack:

> `<victim>` was smashed by `<attacker>`

> `<victim>` was smashed by `<attacker>` with `<weapon>`

### Data Components

The `use_duration` field in the `instrument` data component is rounded down to the nearest tick (0.05 seconds).

The `value` field in the `enchantable` data component is the ["enchantability"](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanting_mechanics#Enchantability) value.

## Text Filtering

`text-filtering-config` in `server.properties` is used to implement Realms text filtering, though third-party servers can also set up their own text filtering service.

Added `text-filtering-version` to `server.properties`. It defaults to version 0 (the existing behavior). No changes were made to the existing behavior.

When `text-filtering-version` is 1, `text-filtering-config` is a JSON object with the following schema:

```java
{
  "apiServer": String, // The server which to send filtering requests to
  "apiPath": String, // The path to the endpoint which to send filtering requests to
  "scope": String, // The OAuth 2.0 scope from Entra ID
  "serverId": String = "", // A string identifying this server
  "applicationId": String, // `clientID` UUID from Entra ID
  "tenantId": String, // `TenantID` from Entra ID (business apps only)
  "roomId": String = "Java:Chat", // A "room ID" sent to the filtering service
  "certificatePath": String, // The path to the X509 certificate file
  "certificatePassword": String = "", // Password used if the certificate is password-protected
  "hashesToDrop": int = -1, // See below
  "maxConcurrentRequests": Integer = 7, // Thread pool size
  "fullyFilteredEvents": String[], // See below
  "connectionReadTimeoutMs": Integer = 2000 // Time to connect before timing out
}
```

`apiPath` no longer requires a leading `/`.

The server uses the [Microsoft Authentication Library for Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/msal/java/) to authenticate with [Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/):

```java
String certificatePath = ...;
String certificatePassword = ...;
String applicationId = ...;
String tenantId = ...;
String scope = ...;

InputStream is = Files.newInputStream(Path.of(certificatePath));
IClientCertificate cert = ClientCredentialFactory.createFromCertificate(is, certificatePassword);

ConfidentialClientApplication client = ConfidentialClientApplication.builder(applicationId, cert)
  .sendX5c(true)
  .executorService(executorService)
  .authority(String.format(Locale.ROOT, "https://login.microsoftonline.com/%s/", tenantId))
  .build();

ClientCredentialParameters params = ClientCredentialParameters.builder(Set.of(scope)).build();
```

All future requests must be authenticated by setting the `Authorization` header to:

```java
"Bearer " + client.acquireToken(params).join()
```

The server sends a POST request to the text filtering endpoint with the following payload:

```java
{
  "userId": String, // UUID of player
  "userDisplayName": String, // Username of player
  "server": String, // `serverId` from config
  "room": String, // `roomId` from config
  "area": "JavaChatRealms",
  "data": String, // Raw chat message text
  "language": "*"
}
```

The text filtering service responds with the following format:

```java
{
  // If null, the entire message will be filtered and replaced with `*`
  "result": {
    // If false, the message will display unchanged
    "filtered": Boolean = true,
    // List of "events" (or rules) that were flagged by the filtering service
    "events": Array[
      {
        "id": String
      }
    ] = [],
    // List of characters to filter and change to `*`
    // Each integer is an index into the chat message string
    "redactedTextIndex": Integer[] = []
  } = null
}
```

If any event ID from the response matches an event ID found in `fullyFilteredEvents` from the config, the entire message will be filtered.

If the number of characters filtered (size of `redactedTextIndex`) is greater than or equal to `hashesToDrop` from the config, the entire message will be filtered. Setting `hashesToDrop` to -1 disables this behavior.
