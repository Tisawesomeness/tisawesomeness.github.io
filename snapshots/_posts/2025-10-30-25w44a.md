Introducing the Camel Husk and the Parched, and horses now float when ridden!

## Camel Husk

Camel Husks have the same size, health, and speed as regular camels. They drop **2-3 rotten flesh** on death.

Camel Husks eat **only** rabbit foot.

Unlike Camels and Zombie Horses, **Camel Husks do not float when ridden.**

When a Husk spawns naturally, there is a **10% chance** it will spawn with an iron spear riding a Camel Husk with a Parched passenger. Camel Husks can only spawn this way.

## Husk

Husks riding a Camel Husk drop 0-4 rabbit foot, depending on the looting level:

| Count       | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | Average |
| ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- |
| Default     | 1/2 | 1/2 |     |     |     | 0.5     |
| Looting I   | 1/4 | 2/4 | 1/4 |     |     | 1       |
| Looting II  | 1/6 | 2/6 | 2/6 | 1/6 |     | 1.5     |
| Looting III | 1/8 | 2/8 | 2/8 | 2/8 | 1/8 | 2       |

## Parched

The Parched has the same size, health, and attack speed as the Bogged. It shoots arrows inflicting Weakness for **30 seconds**.

The Parched spawns in a pack size of 4 in deserts:

| Biome  | Weight | Chance |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Desert | 50/515 | 9.709% |

## Skeleton

Regular skeletons now spawn less often in deserts to make room for Parched spawns:

| Biome  | Old Weight | Old Chance | New Weight | New Chance |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Desert | 100/515    | 19.417%    | 50/515     | 9.709%     |

## Spear

The jab and charge attacks now account for the attackers's forward momentum. If the attacker is moving forward, the attacker's speed in the direction they are looking (in blocks/tick) is added to the spear's range (in blocks).

A mob riding a camel rides at 4Ã— the camel's walking speed while charging.
