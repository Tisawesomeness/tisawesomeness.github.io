The first 1.19.4 pre-release is here with lots of bug fixes. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-19-4-pre-release-1).

# Pink Petals

Pink petals now have 0 hardness and 0 durability, and the same flammability as other flowers.

# Mobs

Donkeys no longer spawn in cherry grove biomes. Pigs spawn instead.

Thorns and explosion damage types no longer trigger Guardians' thorns.

Striders now use the `Strider suffocating modifier` attribute modifier (UUID `9e362924-01de-4ddd-a2b2-d0f7a405a174`) to reduce their walking speed when suffocating. When suffocating, the movement speed attribute will be reduced by 34%.

# Misc

Hitting another entity with a thrown snowball, egg, or ender pearl was incorrectly labeled as the `thorns` damage type. They now use the `thrown` damage type.

# Tags

Suspicious sand was added to the `#sand` block and item tags.

Added the `#smelts_to_glass` block and item tags.

Added the `#always_hurts_ender_dragon` damage type tag.

# Datapacks

Added the `decorated_pot_simple` reicpe for crafting decorated pots with 4 bricks.

Added the `worldgen/multi_noise_biome_source_parameter_list` folder, which contains files in this format:

```json
{
  "preset": "<preset>"
}
```

Where `<preset>` is one of:
```
minecraft:overworld
minecraft:nether
minecraft:overworld_update_1_20
```

# Packets

Added `ClientboundChunksBiomesPacket` for updating the client's chunk biome data.
