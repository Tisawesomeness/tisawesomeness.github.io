A smaller snapshot with some technical changes.

## Data

Added a new loot context parameter: `additional_cost_component_allowed`. It is either present or not present, it has no useful value. It is set in `generic` and `villager_trade` loot tables when a villager is choosing which trades to offer.

The `enchant_with_levels` and `enchant_randomly` loot item functions now require the `additional_cost_component_allowed` loot context parameter (in addition to setting the `include_additional_cost_component` field to true) before adding the `additional_trade_cost` data component. This means the `additional_trade_cost` data component will only be added in villager trades.

## GameTest

Replaced the `time_of_day` [test environment definition](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Test_environment_definition):

```json
{
  "type": "time_of_day",
  "time": <non_negative_integer>
}
```

With the new `clock_time` test environment definition:

```json
{
  "type": "clock_time",
  "clock": <world_clock>,
  "time": <non_negative_integer>
}
```

## JVM Args

The game now runs with three new JVM args by default:

- `-XX:+UseCompactObjectHeaders`
- `-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch`
- `-XX:+UseStringDeduplication`
