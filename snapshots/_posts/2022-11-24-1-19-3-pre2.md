Another pre-release is out with some bugfixes.

# Changes

Mobs can only attack entities riding camels if the mob can reach 0.5 blocks above the entity's actual position.

Villagers can now close doors from up to 3 blocks away instead of 2.

A new item tag was added, `#creeper_igniters` for items that can light creepers. It contains `fire_charge` and `flint_and_steel` by default.

Locate commands now log the elapsed time.
