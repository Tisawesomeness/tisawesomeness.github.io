This snapshot brings unexpected changes to raid spawning mechanics.

## Salmon

Salmon variants now have different hitboxes sizes, fixing [MC-275222](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-275222).

| Type   | Width | Height |
| ------ | ----- | ------ |
| Small  | 0.35  | 0.2    |
| Medium | 0.7   | 0.4    |
| Large  | 1.05  | 0.6    |

## Raids

The way the game chooses where to spawn raiders has changed significantly. Some of these changes are meant to fix [MC-275279](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-275279).

### 24w34a Behavior

The game tries to find a valid spawn point during the 15 second (**300 tick**) countdown before a wave starts. **Every 5 ticks** (starting at 300 ticks, then 295, then 290...), the game attempts **3 times** to pick a spawn location. The game will pick a different spawn location if the existing location is no longer in an entity-ticking chunk without waiting for the 5-tick cycle.

- 300-100 ticks: picks a random location **64 blocks** horizontally away from the raid center, then checks if the highest non-air block is within 64 blocks vertically of the raid center (known as spawning phase 1)
- 300-100 ticks: picks a random location **32 blocks** horizontally away from the raid center, then checks if the highest non-air block is within 32 blocks vertically of the raid center (known as spawning phase 1)
- 39-1 ticks: picks the coordinate **directly at the raid center** (radius 0), but only if the highest non-air block is the raid center (known as spawning phase 3)

| Ticks   | Phase | Radius | Bias | Spawning Area |
| ------- | ----- | ------ | ---- | ------------- |
| 100-300 | 1     | 64     | 0-4  | 69x69         |
| 40-99   | 2     | 32     | 0-4  | 37x37         |
| 1-39    | 3     | 0      | 0-4  | 5x5           |

After the random coordinate is chosen and rounded down, the game selects a random **bias** from **0-4** in the X direction and a random **bias** from **0-4** in the Z direction. The bias is added to the random coordinate to create the spawn location (so the spawn location is biased in the +X and +Z directions).

If the raid countdown expires and there isn't a valid spawn location yet, the game tries **20 attempts** with spawning phase 1, 20 attempts with spawning phase 2, and 20 attempts with spawning phase 3.

### 24w35a Behavior

When the game tries to find a valid spawn point during the wave countdown, it makes **8 attempts** every 5 ticks instead of 3 attempts every 5 ticks.

**The game no longer separates the raid countdown into three spawning phases.** Instead, each 20-tick interval has different radius and bias values (bias is randomly picked from the listed numbers):

| Ticks   | Horizontal Radius | Bias    | Spawning Area |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------- | ------------- |
| 300     | 97.92             | 0,3,6   | 105x105       |
| 280-299 | 90.88             | 0,2,4   | 96x96         |
| 260-279 | 83.84             | 0,2,4   | 89x89         |
| 240-259 | 76.80             | 0,2,4   | 82x82         |
| 220-239 | 69.76             | 0,2,4   | 75x75         |
| 200-219 | 62.72             | 0,1,2   | 66x66         |
| 180-199 | 55.68             | 0,1,2   | 59x59         |
| 160-179 | 48.64             | 0,1,2   | 52x52         |
| 140-159 | 41.60             | 0,1,2   | 45x45         |
| 120-139 | 34.56             | 0,1,2   | 38x38         |
| 100-119 | 27.52             | 0       | 29x29         |
| 80-99   | 20.48             | 0       | 22x22         |
| 60-79   | 13.44             | 0       | 15x15         |
| 40-59   | 6.40              | 0       | 8x8           |
| 20-39   | 0.64              | -2,-1,0 | 4x4           |
| 0-19    | 7.68              | -2,-1,0 | 11x11         |

Note that:
- Horizontal radius ranges from 0.64 to 97.92.
- Bias ranges from -2 to +6.
- The radius decreases with time until it increases between 20-39 ticks and 0-19 ticks.

As an example (assuming the raid center is at (0, 0)), if the raid countdown is within 20-39 ticks, the radius is 0.64 and the bias is either -2, -1, or 0. Since the selected coordinate within the 0.64 block ring is rounded down to the nearest block, the possible coordinates are a 2x2 square: (0, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1), and (-1, -1). Accounting for the -2 to 0 bias, mobs can spawn in a 4x4 square with the raid center in the +X+Z corner.

When the spawn location is selected, the highest non-air block now must be within **96 blocks** (instead of 0, 32, or 64 blocks) vertically of the raid center. This applies to **every** wave, not just the starting wave.

If the raid countdown expires and there isn't a valid spawn location yet, the game tries **5 times** (instead of 3 times), 20 attempts each, to find a valid spawn location. **The radius is always 7.68 and the bias is always from -2 to 0.**

Previously, each attempt would select a completely random point on the spawning ring. Now, for each set of attempts (8 attempts during countdown and 20 attempts after countdown), the game chooses the point on a random starting angle, then tries increasing the angle in 1/16th increments. This causes the game to search a half-circle arc during each countdown attempt, and to search the full circle once the countdown has finished.

### Code Comparison

The old behavior is equivalent to the following code:

```java
public void tick() {
  if (!shouldTryToFindSpawnLocation()) {
    return;
  }

  if (raidCooldownTicks > 0) {

    // Tries the 3 spawning phases in order depending on time left
    int spawningPhase;
    if (raidCooldownTicks >= 100) {
      spawningPhase = 1; // 100-300 ticks
    } else if (raidCooldownTicks >= 40) {
      spawningPhase = 2; // 40-99 ticks
    } else {
      spawningPhase = 3; // 0-39 ticks
    }
    spawnLocation = findRaidSpawn(3, spawningPhase);

  } else {

    // When countdown expires, game tries all 3 spawning phases
    // one after the other as a last ditch effort
    for (int spawningPhase = 0; spawningPhase < 3; spawningPhase++) {
      if (spawnLocation != null) {
        spawnLocation = findRaidSpawn(20, spawningPhase);
      }
    }

  }
}

private BlockPos findRaidSpawn(int numAttempts, int spawningPhase) {
  for (int i = 0; i < numAttempts; i++) {
    // Random angle chosen per attempt
    float randomAngle = random.nextFloat() * (float) (Math.PI * 2);

    // Radius 64 for spawning phase 1,
    // 32 for phase 2,
    // 0 for phase 3
    int spawnRingRadius = 64 - 32 * (spawningPhase - 1);
    // Biases from 0-4 are chosen separately for X and Z directions
    int biasX = random.nextInt(5);
    int biasZ = random.nextInt(5);

    // Spawn locations are floored to nearest block position
    int spawnX = center.getX() + (int) Math.floor(Math.cos(randomAngle) * spawnRingRadius + biasX);
    int spawnZ = center.getZ() + (int) Math.floor(Math.sin(randomAngle) * spawnRingRadius + biasZ);

    // The highest block in the column must be within a
    // certain vertical distance from the raid center:
    // 64 blocks (phase 1)
    // 32 blocks (phase 2)
    // 0 blocks (phase 3)
    int spawnY = getHighestNonAirBlockY(spawnX, spawnZ);
    if (Math.abs(center.getY() - spawnY) <= spawnRingRadius) {
      return new BlockPos(spawnX, spawnY, spawnZ);
    }

  }
  return null;
}
```

The new behavior is equivalent to the following code:

```java
public void tick() {
  if (!shouldTryToFindSpawnLocation()) {
    return;
  }

  // No more separation into spawning "phases"
  if (raidCooldownTicks > 0) {
    // During countdown, 8 attempts every 5 ticks
    // (unless existing position unloads)
    spawnLocation = findRaidSpawn(8);
  } else {
    // Once countdown expires, game does 100 attempts total
    // Unlike before, the ring radius and bias does not change
    // Radius is always 7.68 and bias is always -2, -1, or 0
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      if (spawnLocation != null) {
        spawnLocation = findRaidSpawn(20);
      }
    }
  }
}

private BlockPos findRaidSpawn(int numAttempts) {
  int raidCooldownSeconds = raidCooldownTicks / 20;

  // Now chooses a starting angle, then increases the angle
  // for each attempt in 1/16th increments
  // During countdown, sweeps through a half-circle
  // When countdown expires, sweeps through a circle and a quarter
  float randomStartAngle = random.nextFloat() * (float) (Math.PI * 2);
  for (int i = 0; i < numAttempts; i++) {
    float currentAngle = randomStartAngle + i * (float) (Math.PI / 8);

    // See table for radius and bias values
    float spawnRingRadius = Math.abs(7.04f * (float) raidCooldownSeconds - 7.68f);
    int biasX = random.nextInt(3) * (int) Math.floor(0.22f * (float) raidCooldownSeconds - 0.24f);
    int biasZ = random.nextInt(3) * (int) Math.floor(0.22f * (float) raidCooldownSeconds - 0.24f);

    // Spawn locations are still floored to nearest block position
    int spawnX = center.getX() + (int) Math.floor(Math.cos(currentAngle) * spawnRingRadius + biasX);
    int spawnZ = center.getZ() + (int) Math.floor(Math.sin(currentAngle) * spawnRingRadius + biasZ);

    // The highest block in the column must be within
    // 96 blocks vertically of the raid center,
    // no longer a variable radius based on spawning phase
    int spawnY = getHighestNonAirBlockY(spawnX, spawnZ);
    if (Math.abs(center.getY() - spawnY) <= 96) {
      return new BlockPos(spawnX, spawnY, spawnZ);
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

Both behaviors share the following code:

```java
private int raidCooldownTicks; // decrements from 300 to 0
private BlockPos center; // raid center
private BlockPos spawnLocation; // location raiders will be spawned, may be null

private boolean shouldTryToFindSpawnLocation() {
  if (spawnLocation == null) {
    // Try to find spawn location every 5 ticks...
    return raidCooldownTicks % 5 == 0;
  } else {
    // ...unless spawn location is no longer entity-ticking
    return !isEntityTicking(spawnLocation);
  }
}
```
