Another snapshot with bug fixes.

## Mob Attack Reach Changes

Mobs now always need to have line of sight to attack other entities, fixing [MC-264915](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-264915).

## Head Blocks

All head and skull blocks now have a `powered` property.

## Servers

Servers now check if the server is full and the player is banned/whitelisted when the client finishes the configuration phase, in addition to checking when the client account is verified (end of login phase).
