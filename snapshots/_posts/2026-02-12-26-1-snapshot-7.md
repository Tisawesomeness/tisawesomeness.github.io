Even more baby remodels and technical changes.

## Blocks

Any copper block can be used as the trumpet instrument.

## Mobs

The hitbox sizes for baby mobs have changed:

| Mob                   | Width      | Height        | Eye Height   |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Baby Drowned          | 0.3 → 0.55 | 0.975 → 1.08  | 0.87 → 0.775 |
| Baby Husk             | 0.3 → 0.55 | 0.975 → 1.125 | 0.87 → 0.825 |
| Baby Piglin           | 0.3 → 0.55 | 0.975 → 0.95  | 0.97 → 0.78  |
| Baby Villager         | 0.3 → 0.5  | 0.975 → 0.93  | 0.81 → 0.63  |
| Baby Zombie           | 0.3 → 0.5  | 0.975 → 1.07  | 0.93 → 0.775 |
| Baby Zombie Villager  | 0.3 → 0.5  | 0.975 → 1.0   | 0.93 → 0.67  |
| Baby Zombified Piglin | 0.3 → 0.55 | 0.975 → 0.95  | 0.97 → 0.78  |

Rabbits now wait a minimum of **3 ticks** between jumps, up from 1 tick.

## Chat

When player chat messages are disabled (either through the chat settings screen, the launcher, or account settings), players can use commands except for `/say`, `/me`, `/msg`, `/teammsg`, and `/kick`, `/ban`, and `/banip` with the reason argument (players can still kick and ban without providing a reason). Custom commands with signed arguments will also be disabled.

Reporting other players' chat messages is now disabled when receiving player chat messages is disabled.

## Debug Properties

Added `-DMC_DEBUG_CHAT_DISABLED`, which acts as if the user's chat is disabled in their account settings.
