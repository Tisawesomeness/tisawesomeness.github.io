Some tweaks to the new features in the last snapshot, and a new environment attributes system.

## Nautilus

A regular nautilus moves at 0.02 blocks/tick when ridden on land.

Nautilus offspring are now tamed if their parents are tamed, like other tameable mobs such as wolves.

Baby nautiluses can eat and be healed by any nautilus food, fixing [MC-302783](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-302783). Untamed adults still can only eat pufferfish and bucketed pufferfish.

Baby nautiluses follow players at a distance of **2.5 blocks** when tempted.

## Zombie Nautilus

A zombie nautilus moves at 0.022 blocks/tick when ridden on land.

## Spear

The spear's contact cooldown ticks is still 10.

## Misc

Entities using elytra can now fly through cave vines.

## Technical Changes

### Debug

Added the `-DMC_DEBUG_ACTIVE_TEXT_AREAS` debug property. It highlights all rendered text components:
