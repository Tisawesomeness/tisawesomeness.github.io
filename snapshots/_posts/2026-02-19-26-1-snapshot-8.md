## Mobs

### Baby Mobs

The hitbox sizes for baby mobs have changed:

| Mob                   | Width       | Height       | Eye Height |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Baby Drowned          | 0.55 → 0.49 | 1.08 → 0.99  | 0.775      |
| Baby Husk             | 0.55 → 0.49 | 1.125 → 0.99 | 0.825      |
| Baby Piglin           | 0.55 → 0.49 | 0.95 → 0.99  | 0.78       |
| Baby Villager         | 0.5 → 0.49  | 0.93 → 0.99  | 0.63       |
| Baby Zombie           | 0.5 → 0.49  | 1.07 → 0.99  | 0.775      |
| Baby Zombie Villager  | 0.5 → 0.49  | 1.0 → 0.99   | 0.67       |
| Baby Zombified Piglin | 0.55 → 0.49 | 0.95 → 0.99  | 0.78       |

### Pathfinding

Horses and zombie horses can now traverse paths with neighboring cactus or sweet berry bush blocks (with a penalty of 8).

## Debug Menu

The `memory` debug option now displays MiB instead of MB (previously, memory was measured in MiB but incorrectly displayed MB).

The `detailed_memory` debug option shows heap and non-heap memory, where:

- `i` = Initial memory, allocated at JVM startup
- `u` = Used memory
- `c` = Committed memory, currently reserved by the operating system for the JVM
- `m` = Maximum memory, may display as `000MiB` if there is no maximum

## Debug Properties

Added `-DMC_DEBUG_PREFER_WAYLAND`, which tells GLFW to use the Wayland platform instead of X11 on Linux. Otherwise, Minecraft will use X11 even if Wayland is supported. See the [GLFW docs](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/intro_guide.html#platform) for details.

Removed `-DMC_DEBUG_DUMP_INTERPOLATED_TEXTURE_FRAMES`.
