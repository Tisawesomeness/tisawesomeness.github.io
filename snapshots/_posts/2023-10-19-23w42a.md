It's here.

## The Crafter

The Crafter has a hardness of 1.5 and a blast resistance of 3.5. The best tool to mine the Crafter is the pickaxe. The Crafter is in the `#needs_stone_tools` block tag, but still drops when mined by any tool or by hand.

The Crafter will craft an item on every pulse, no matter how fast.

The Crafter is unaffected by the `doLimitedCrafting` gamerule.

## Gameplay

Firework rockets can now break pointed dripstone, decorated pots, and chorus fruit (fixing [MC-223774](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-223774)). Firework rockets were added to the `#impact_projectiles` entity type tag.

The `playersNetherPortalDefaultDelay` and `playersNetherPortalCreativeDelay` gamerules can be set to any number, but portals always have a 1 tick delay minimum.

## Mojang API

The [usernames to UUIDs endpoint](https://wiki.vg/Mojang_API#Usernames_to_UUIDs) moved from `https://api.mojang.com/profiles/minecraft` to `https://sessionserver.mojang.com/session/minecraft/profile/lookup/bulk/byname`.
