A smaller snapshot with tweaks to the Copper Golem and more.

## Copper Chest

Explosion resistance was increased from 2.5 to **6**.

Waxing or unwaxing a double copper chest now emits a `block_change` vibration (frequency 11) from *both* chest blocks, rather than just the block that was clicked.

## Copper Golem

To reach a chest horizontally, the copper golem’s hitbox must be less than 0.2 blocks from the chest’s hitbox in both the X and Z axes (chessboard distance).

Copper golems can reach a chest:
- One block higher if it is standing on anything taller than 0.499 blocks tall (or the golem is midair at the equivalent y-level), previously was 0.5 blocks
- At the same level always
- One block lower if it is standing on anything shorter than 0.375 blocks tall (or the golem is midair at the equivalent y-level)

A copper golem will give up trying to reach a chest and find a new target if:
- The current copper golem’s hitbox is less than 0.5 blocks from the chest’s hitbox in both the X and Z axes (chessboard distance)
- The copper golem’s position is within **0.499 blocks** (inclusive, previously was 0.5 blocks) to 2 blocks (exclusive) below the chest
