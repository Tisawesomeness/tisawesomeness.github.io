The first 1.20.5 pre-release is out, tweaking potion effects and Ominous Trials. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-20-5-pre-release-1).

## Status Effects

### Infested

Silverfish are now launched outwards at a random angle **within 90 degrees** of the mob's facing direction. Mobs with Infested now spawn 1-2 silverfish instead of 1-3.

### Oozing

The 5×5×5 area in the changelog is incorrect. When a mob with Oozing dies, the game takes the mob's bounding box, expands it by 2 blocks on all sides (for example, a 4.4×4.3×4.4 box for silverfish), then scans for slimes in that area. The game will not exceed `max_entity_cramming` slimes within that box.

### Weaving

Mobs that die with the Weaving effect now try to place cobwebs within a **3×3×3 block cube** instead of a 7×7×7 block cube. They will attempt to place cobwebs **15 times** instead of 10 times.

If the same block is picked multiple times, the game will no longer count that block twice towards the maximum cobweb count. This causes cobwebs to spawn slightly more often.

## Mace

Smash attacks and Wind Burst now **only work on living entities**.

## Trial Spawner

If a mob is given armor by an Ominous Trial Spawner, the armor will be enchanted with Protection IV, Projectile Protection IV, **and** Fire Protection IV **at the same time**.

Mobs spawned by an Ominous Trial Spawner that can use melee weapons are given a random weapon:

| Item          | Enchantments | Chance |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| Iron Sword    |              | 4/7    |
| Iron Sword    | Sharpness I  | 1/7    |
| Iron Sword    | Knockback I  | 1/7    |
| Diamond Sword |              | 1/7    |

Mobs spawned by an Ominous Trial Spawner that can use bows are given a random bow:

| Item | Enchantments | Weight |
| ---- | ------------ | ------ |
| Bow  |              | 50%    |
| Bow  | Power I      | 25%    |
| Bow  | Punch I      | 25%    |

## Trial Chambers

The "Assembly" chamber has a chance to generate with a trapped Trial Spawner.
