New wolf sounds and spawn egg textures. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-25w08a).

## Wolf

When two wolves are bred, the baby wolf will get a completely random sound variant, including sound variants that do not belong to either parent.

Wolves from before the update will keep their classic sounds.

## Sheep

The sheep spawn color rules have changed:

| Cold       | Temperate  | Warm       | Chance  |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Black      | White      | Brown      | 81.836% |
| White      | Black      | White      | 5%      |
| Light Gray | Light Gray | Light Gray | 5%      |
| Gray       | Gray       | Gray       | 5%      |
| Brown      | Brown      | Black      | 3%      |
| Pink       | Pink       | Pink       | 0.164%  |
