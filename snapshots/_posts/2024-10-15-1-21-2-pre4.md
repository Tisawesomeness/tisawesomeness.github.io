A few more bugfixes. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-2-pre-release-4).

## Projectiles

Arrows and tridents now check for collisions before applying gravity and inertia again. Additionally, arrows and tridents now apply inertia before gravity. This may affect sensitive contraptions using projectile motion.
