The third pre-release changes glow squid spawning conditions and fixes more bugs.

# Axolotl / Glow Squid Spawning

Underwater cave mobs must spawn within 5 blocks of "natural stone". Natural stone is the blocks in the `base_stone_overworld` tag: stone, granite, diorite, andesite, tuff, and deepslate. It does **not** have to be naturally generated stone. There cannot be any block other than water between the stone and the spawn position.
