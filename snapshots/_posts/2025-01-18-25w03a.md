The GameTest system is now open to the public. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-25w03a).

## Leaf Litter

Using leaf litter on a composter has a **30% chance** to raise the compost level by 1.

## Minecarts

If a minecart's `Motion` in the x, y, or z directions is `NaN`, then the minecart's motion will be treated as zero in all directions.

## GameTest

**The changelog is incorrect. The `environment` test instance field should instead be called `batch`.**

When the GameTest server is started from command line, the server creates a superflat world with no structures and seed 0 (the number zero). Difficulty defaults to normal. All available feature flags except `redstone_experiments` and `minecart_improvements` will be enabled (this includes `trade_rebalance`).

Unlike how GameTest worked previously, no gamerules are changed by default. To restore previous behavior, set the following gamerules:

```json
{
  "type": "minecraft:game_rules",
  "bool_rules": [
    {
      "rule": "doMobSpawning",
      "value": false
    },
    {
      "rule": "doWeatherCycle",
      "value": false
    },
    {
      "rule": "doFireTick",
      "value": false
    }
  ],
  "int_rules": [
    {
      "rule": "randomTickSpeed",
      "value": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Tests spawn at a random coordinate between -14,999,992 and 14,999,992 in the x/z directions, and always at y=-59.

### Exit Codes

| Scenario                                | Exit Code            |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| All required tests pass                 | 0                    |
| Some required tests failed              | (number of failures) |
| Server shut down without starting tests | -1                   |
| Failed to load vanilla datapack         | -1                   |
| Crash                                   | 1                    |

### Test Block

The Test Block has one block state: `test_block_mode`, which can be one of `start`, `log`, `fail`, or `accept`. It does not change state when powered, so it will not trigger observers when powered.
