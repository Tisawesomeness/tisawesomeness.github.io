This snapshot adjusts the spear and the lunge enchantment to be a little easier to use.

## Spear

When a player or mob uses the spear's charge attack, their base attack damage is added to the [spear's damage](/snapshots/25w41a#charge-attack):

| Mob              | Base Damage |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Player           | 1           |
| Zombie           | 3           |
| Zombie Villager  | 3           |
| Husk             | 3           |
| Zombified Piglin | 5           |

Piglins are not included in this list because they do not use charge attacks.

### Lunge

Even if the Lunge enchantment's hunger cost is removed from its enchantment definition, Lunge still requires at least 6 hunger points.
