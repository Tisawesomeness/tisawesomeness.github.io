More tweaks to experiments and performance improvements.

## Breeze

Breezes now shoot wind charges from 1.185 blocks from the bottom of the breeze instead of 0.9452 blocks, fixing [MC-269376](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-269376).

## Minecarts

Minecarts now store whether it has processed a tick in the `HasTicked` NBT boolean regardless of whether the minecart experiment is enabled.

### Minecart Experiment

Minecarts used to snap to a rail while falling if the block below is a rail. Now, minecarts snap if the minecart is 0.1 blocks above a rail block or less (or 1.1 blocks above the ground with a rail on top).

Minecarts no longer snap to 0.6 blocks above the ground if the rail is sloped because minecarts may snap to the rail further up or down the slope.

## Data Components

The `consume_seconds` field in the `consumable` data component is rounded down to the nearest tick (0.05 seconds).
