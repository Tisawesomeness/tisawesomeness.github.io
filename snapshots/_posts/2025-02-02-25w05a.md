You would not believe your eyes.

## Bush

Using bonemeal on a bush will attempt to place a neighboring bush one block to the north, east, south, or west. If multiple blocks are valid, a random one is chosen.

## Firefly Bush

Firefly bushes spawn firefly particles if the current block and sky brightness is 13 or lower. Fireflies spawn up to 5 blocks away in the x and z directions, and up to 5 blocks up in the y direction.

## Ambient Sounds

A Dead bush plays ambient sounds 5 times more often if the dead bush is placed on a regular sand block.

Sand, red sand, and any color of terracotta can play ambient sounds if the block is the topmost block in the world. That block checks the topmost blocks 8 blocks away in the north, east, south, and west directions. If at least 3 out of 4 blocks are in the `#plays_ambient_desert_block_sounds` tag (sand, red sand, and `#terracotta`), an ambient sound can be played.

If sand, red sand, or a terracotta block is removed from the `#plays_ambient_desert_block_sounds` tag, it will no longer play ambient sounds.
