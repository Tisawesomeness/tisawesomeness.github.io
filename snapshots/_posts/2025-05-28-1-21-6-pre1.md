The first pre-release for 1.12.6 is out! See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-6-pre-release-1).

## Happy Ghast

When the Happy Ghast has no players on top of itself, excluding passengers (checked every tick), it will stop moving for half a second. If there are also no passengers, the Happy Ghast will stop moving for two seconds instead. If a player rides a Happy Ghast with no passengers or players on top of it, the Happy Ghast will be able to move immediately. This behavior is implemented by the `still_timeout` NBT integer field, a value counting down from 40 to 0.
