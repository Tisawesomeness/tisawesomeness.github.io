Another snapshot is out with highly-requested bugfixes.

## Logo

The Minecraft Java Edition logo has changed. See the Minecraft [news article](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/our-icons-are-changing) for a comparison.

## Enchanting

Blocks in the `enchantment_power_transmitter` block tag no longer block the connection between enchanting tables and bookshelves. The tag only contains the `replaceable` tag by default, which contains all blocks that can be replaced by placing another block in the same location.

The list of blocks that no longer block bookshelves is:

- Air, Cave Air, Void Air
- Water, Lava, Bubble Column
- Some tall flowers
  - Sunflower
  - Lilac
  - Rose Bush
  - Peony
- Tall Grass, Tall Seagrass, Large Fern
- Hanging Roots
- Crimson Roots, Warped Roots, Nether Sprouts
- Fire, Soul Fire
- Vines, Glow Lichen
- Snow layers
- Light blocks
- Structure Void

The `enchantment_power_provider` block tag now controls which blocks power up enchanting tables. The tag contains only regular bookshelves by default.

## Mobs

Sniffers can now be tempted with torchflower seeds, and do not dig while tempted.

Villagers can now pick up torchflower seeds and pitcher pods, fixing [MC-260810](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260810).

## Blocks

Torchflower and pitcher plants are now flammable. They have the same flammability as other flowers.

Bonemealing a torchflower always grows it by 1 stage.

Pitcher plants now craft 2 cyan dye instead of one.

Spreading sculk can now replace red sand.

Shovels are now the best tools for suspiciuos blocks, fixing [MC-261167](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-261167).

## Desert Pyramid

Desert pyramids generate an extra suspicious sand in the top layer. The structure now generates 6-9 suspicious sand in total.

## Tags

Cactus and sugar cane can now grow on blocks added to the `#sand` block tag.

`/spreadplayers` no longer teleports players onto blocks added to the `#fire` block tag.
