---

This snapshot adds data-driven jukeboxes and portal changes.

## Blocks

Trial spawners now convert Bad Omen to Trial Omen and convert the spawner into an Ominous Trial Spawner at the same time, rather than converting the potion effect, waiting one second for the next detection, then converting the spawner to ominous.

## Entities

When the `entitiesWithPassengersCanUsePortals` gamerule is true, ridden entities only go through portals if the **controlling passenger** is inside the portal. Players riding an entity do not experience the normal portal delay.

Wind charges can no longer be hit or deflected for 5 ticks after spawning, fixing [MC-270377](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-270377).

## Data

The `min_cost` field in the `by_cost_with_difficulty` enchantment provider now has a max of 10,000.

## Attributes

A list of built-in modifiers and their new IDs is available in [PDF format](/snapshots/resources/24w21b_AttributeConversionTable.pdf) and in [JSON format](/snapshots/resources/24w21b_attribute_conversion.json).

Due to [MC-277234](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-277234), the game incorrectly converts `effect.minecraft.mining_fatigue` to `effect.minining_fatigue`. This is not reflected in the above files.

## Edits

### May 23 2024

- Add note that Mojang made a typo when converting attributes.
