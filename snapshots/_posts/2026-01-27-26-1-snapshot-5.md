Keep your baby mobs forever!

## Golden Dandelion

Feeding a baby mob a golden dandelion also resets its age to the minimum possible value (20 minutes to grow into an adult).

Golden dandelions have a 2 second cooldown per mob. This does not persist across unloads and reloads.

Golden dandelions have the same suspicious stew effects as regular dandelions: Saturation I for 0.35 seconds.

Wandering traders sell up to 12 golden dandelions for 2 emeralds each.

## Baby Mobs

The hitbox sizes for baby mobs have changed:

| Mob             | Width       | Height      | Eye Height    |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Baby Squid      | 0.4 → 0.5   | 0.4 → 0.63  | 0.2 → 0.37    |
| Baby Glow Squid | 0.4 → 0.5   | 0.4 → 0.63  | 0.2 → 0.37    |
| Baby Axolotl    | 0.375 → 0.5 | 0.21 → 0.25 | 0.13755 → 0.2 |

## Data

### Entity NBT

Ageable mobs store whether they are age-locked in an `AgeLocked` boolean field.

### Tags

The `#cannot_be_age_locked` entity tag only contains hoglins and camel husks. Villagers cannot be age locked due to hardcoded behavior.

### Loot Functions

Added a new optional `use_input_count` boolean field (default true) to the `furnace_smelt` loot function:
- If true, the output is the result of smelting each individual input item (within stack size limits)
- If false, the output is the result of smelting a single input item (within stack size limits)

The fix to [MC-306004](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-305693) also applies to the `furnace_smelt` loot function.
