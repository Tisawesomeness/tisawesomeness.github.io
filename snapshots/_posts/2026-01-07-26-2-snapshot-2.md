This first snapshot of 2026 adds new baby mob models.

## Mobs

Some mob bounding boxes have changed:

| Mob          | Width      | Height     | Eye Height    |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Adult Rabbit | 0.4 → 0.49 | 0.5 → 0.6  | 0.425 → 0.63  |
| Baby Rabbit  | 0.2 → 0.24 | 0.25 → 0.4 | 0.2125 → 0.44 |
| Baby Chicken | 0.2 → 0.3  | 0.35 → 0.4 | 0.2975 → 0.28 |

### Rabbits

A rabbit jump now lasts 15 ticks, up from 10 ticks. Rabbits now jump higher and less far forward with each jump.

## GameTest

Added `padding` (integer from 0-128, default 0) to the [test instance definition](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Test_instance_definition). It expands the test bounding box by `padding` blocks in every direction around the test structure.
