This massive snapshot adds the spear, nautilus, and zombie horse!

## Nautilus

The Nautilus has **15 health** and **30% knockback resistance**. It has a movement speed attribute of 1.0. It is an aquatic mob.

|       | Width  | Height | Eye Height |
| ----- | ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| Adult | 0.875  | 0.95   | 0.2751     |
| Baby  | 0.4375 | 0.475  | 0.13755    |

When killed by a player, a regular nautilus drops 1-3 experience and has a **5% chance** to drop a nautilus shell.

The nautilus is immune to poison and cannot be pushed by flowing fluids.

A nautilus can breathe outside of water for **11 seconds**, after which it will take 2 damage every second.

If a player without the Breath of the Nautilus effect rides a nautilus, the player will **immediately** get Breath of the Nautilus for 3 seconds. Then, the potion effect is refreshed on a global 2 second timer.

A regular nautilus moves at 0.0325 blocks/tick when ridden. Passengers ride the nautilus 1.1375 blocks above the nautilus' position.

A regular nautilus will panic when hit, moving at 1.6× speed.

A tamed nautilus' roaming restriction is a sphere of 16 blocks with a saddle and 32 blocks without a saddle. A tamed nautilus updates its home (the center of its roaming restriction) whenever a saddle is equipped or unequipped, or after it strays an additional 8 blocks from its restricted area.

### Spawning

A nautilus can spawn within **5-25 blocks below sea level**, as long as the block directly above and below the spawn location contains water. Nautiluses spawn in the following biomes:

| Biome               | Weight | Chance  |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Cold Ocean          | 2/5    | 40%     |
| Deep Cold Ocean     | 2/5    | 40%     |
| Deep Frozen Ocean   | 2/3    | 66.667% |
| Deep Lukewarm Ocean | 5/15   | 33.333% |
| Deep Ocean          | 5/7    | 71.426% |
| Frozen Ocean        | 2/3    | 66.667% |
| Lukewarm Ocean      | 5/17   | 29.412% |
| Ocean               | 5/7    | 71.426% |
| Warm Ocean          | 5/17   | 29.412% |

Nautiluses spawn with pack size 1.

Regular nautiluses are part of the **water creature** mob cap.

### Food

An untamed nautilus can only be fed with pufferfish or a bucket of pufferfish, with a **1/3 chance** of taming the nautilus. Feeding a baby nautilus a pufferfish or bucket of pufferfish speeds up its growth by 10% of the remaining time to grow up.

Tamed nautiluses can be fed any food in the below table:

| Food                    | Heals |
| ----------------------- | ----- |
| Bucket of Cod           | 1     |
| Bucket of Salmon        | 1     |
| Bucket of Pufferfish    | 1     |
| Bucket of Tropical Fish | 1     |
| Pufferfish              | 2     |
| Tropical Fish           | 2     |
| Raw Cod                 | 4     |
| Raw Salmon              | 4     |
| Cooked Cod              | 10    |
| Cooked Salmon           | 12    |

Adult nautiluses can be bred and tempted with any food in the above table. While breeding, they move at 0.4× speed and can breed up to 2 blocks away from each other. While tempted, they move at 1.3× speed and follow players at a distance of **3.5 blocks**.

### Dash Attack

**Every 2-3 minutes**, a nautilus has a 50% chance to look for a pufferfish to attack. The target must be in water and within 16 blocks of the nautilus. Regular nautiluses also wait 2-3 minutes before looking for their first pufferfish.

When a player hurts a nautilus, and the player is **within 16 blocks**, the nautilus will get angry at the player for **20 seconds** and attack. Players are prioritized over pufferfish.

When a nautilus performs a dash attack, it travels at a constant 0.6 blocks/tick until it collides with any entity, dealing **3 damage**. Dash attacks have a **4 second cooldown**.

A nautilus will only perform a dash attack in water. Baby nautiluses do not attack.

A nautilus will stop a dash attack if either:
- It no longer has line of sight with its target (using collision hitboxes)
- Its target strays more than 11 blocks away from the nautilus
- Its target strays more than 12 blocks away from the dash's starting position

**Tamed nautiluses do not attack.** Taming a nautilus stops any dash attack in progress.

A regular nautilus deals knockback according to the below formula in blocks/tick:

$$ 1.2 \cdot \text{clamp}\left(\text{movementSpeed}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{10}{3}\right) + \frac{\text{speedLevel} - \text{slownessLevel}}{2} $$

Or, when `movementSpeed` is the default:

$$ 1.2 + \frac{\text{speedLevel} - \text{slownessLevel}}{2} $$

## Zombie Nautilus

The Zombie Nautilus has a movement speed attribute of 1.1. It is an aquatic and undead mob that burns in daylight.

When killed by a player, a regular nautilus drops 1-3 experience and has a **5% chance** to drop a nautilus shell.

A zombie nautilus is hostile if it is ridden by a hostile mob. Otherwise, it becomes neutral like a regular nautilus.

A zombie nautilus moves at 0.03575 blocks/tick when ridden.

### Dash Attack

A zombie nautilus travels at 0.5 blocks/tick during a dash attack.

A zombie nautilus deals knockback according to the below formula in blocks/tick:

$$ \text{clamp}\left(\text{movementSpeed}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{10}{3}\right) + \frac{\text{speedLevel} - \text{slownessLevel}}{2} $$

Or, when `movementSpeed` is the default:

$$ 1.1 + \frac{\text{speedLevel} - \text{slownessLevel}}{2} $$

## Nautilus Armor

| Tier      | Armor | Toughness |
| --------- |:-----:|:---------:|
| Copper    |   4   |           |
| Iron      |   5   |           |
| Gold      |   7   |           |
| Diamond   |  11   |     2     |
| Netherite |  19   |     3     |

Netherite nautilus armor also gives **1 knockback resistance**.

## Breath of the Nautilus

The Breath of the Nautilus effect additionally prevents oxygen **regeneration** from other sources, such as the Water Breathing effect.

## Spear

Spears have a range of **2 to 4.5 blocks**. Enemy hitboxes are expanded by 0.25 blocks in each direction when checking for collision, so spears have an effective range of **2.25 to 4.75 blocks** when attacking an enemy head on, and **2.433 to 4.933 blocks** when attacking an enemy from one of the hitbox's eight corners.

Killing another player with either a jab attack or charge attack has a new death message:

> `<victim>` was speared by `<attacker>`

> `<victim>` was speared by `<attacker>` with `<weapon>`

Spears have the same durability and enchantability as other weapons of the same material. A wooden spear can smelt one item in a furnace.

### Jab Attack

| Tier      | Attack Damage | Attack Speed | Attack Cooldown |
| --------- |:-------------:|:------------:|:---------------:|
| Wood      |       1       |     1.54     |    0.65 sec     |
| Stone     |       2       |     1.33     |    0.75 sec     |
| Copper    |       2       |     1.18     |    0.85 sec     |
| Iron      |       3       |     1.05     |    0.95 sec     |
| Gold      |       1       |     1.05     |    0.95 sec     |
| Diamond   |       4       |     0.95     |    1.05 sec     |
| Netherite |       5       |     0.87     |    1.15 sec     |

### Charge Attack

The spear's base damage is the player's horizontal velocity (in blocks/tick) relative to the target's horizontal velocity, multiplied by a multiplier in the table below, rounded down:

$$ \lfloor \text{relativeHorizontalVelocity} \cdot \text{multiplier} \rfloor $$

| Tier      | Multiplier |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Wood      | 0.7×       |
| Stone     | 0.82×      |
| Copper    | 0.82×      |
| Iron      | 0.95×      |
| Gold      | 0.7×       |
| Diamond   | 1.075×     |
| Netherite | 1.2×       |

Enchantments apply after the above formula.

Each material has different stats for timing shown in the below table (in seconds):

| Tier      | Delay | Engaged             | Tired             | Disengaged        |
| --------- | ----- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Wood      | 0.75  | 15.00 (15.75 total) | 6.0 (21.75 total) | 5.0 (26.75 total) |
| Stone     | 0.70  | 13.75 (14.45 total) | 5.5 (19.95 total) | 4.5 (24.45 total) |
| Copper    | 0.65  | 12.50 (13.15 total) | 5.0 (18.15 total) | 4.0 (22.15 total) |
| Iron      | 0.60  | 11.25 (11.85 total) | 4.5 (16.35 total) | 2.5 (18.85 total) |
| Gold      | 0.70  | 13.75 (14.45 total) | 5.5 (19.95 total) | 3.5 (23.45 total) |
| Diamond   | 0.50  | 10.00 (10.50 total) | 4.0 (14.50 total) | 3.0 (17.50 total) |
| Netherite | 0.40  | 8.75 (9.15 total)   | 3.5 (12.65 total) | 2.5 (15.15 total) |

A player using an engaged spear must be moving at the below horizontal speed or faster to dismount enemies:

| Tier      | Min Dismount Speed |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| Wood      | 0.7 blocks/tick    |
| Stone     | 0.5 blocks/tick    |
| Copper    | 0.45 blocks/tick   |
| Iron      | 0.4 blocks/tick    |
| Gold      | 0.5 blocks/tick    |
| Diamond   | 0.375 blocks/tick  |
| Netherite | 0.35 blocks/tick   |

A player using an engaged or tired spear must be moving horizontally at 0.255 blocks/tick to knockback enemies.

A player using a spear must be moving horizontally at 0.23 blocks/tick relative to the enemy's horizontal velocity to deal damage. Note that it is possible for an attack to knockback enemies but deal no damage.

### Lunge Enchantment

| Level | Weight | Anvil cost per level | Treasure | Can be found in normal loot |
| ----- | ------ | -------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| 1-5   | 5      | 2                    | No       | Yes                         |

**The Lunge enchantment is exclusive with Mending.**

After the enchanting table calculates the [modified enchantment level](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanting_mechanics#How_enchantments_are_chosen), it uses the below table to determine which enchantments are possible for a given modified enchantment level:

| Level | Modified Enchantment Level |
| ----- |:--------------------------:|
| 1     |            5-25            |
| 2     |           13-33            |
| 3     |           21-41            |

When doing a jab attack with Lunge, the player is propelled horizontally where they are looking:

$$ \text{velocity} = \text{maxVelocity} \cdot \cos(\text{pitch}) $$

| Level | Max Velocity      | Durability Loss |
| ----- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| 1     | 0.458 blocks/tick | 8               |
| 2     | 0.916 blocks/tick | 32              |
| 3     | 1.374 blocks/tick | 128             |

Lunge cannot be used while riding any entity or while using elytra.

### Mob Usage

Zombies, zombie villagers, husks, and zombified piglins only use the spear's charge attack, and therefore do not use the Lunge enchantment.

Piglins and other mobs do not charge with a spear, and instead use the spear as a regular melee weapon, without any extra reach. These mobs can use the Lunge enchantment.

Mobs charging with a spear have a range of **1 to 2.25 blocks**. Unlike players, mobs do **not** expand target hitboxes to make it easier to hit targets. Mobs **cannot** use the Lunge enchantment.

If the mob is riding another entity, it moves at 1.4× speed while charging.

Mobs need only 20% of the speed a player does to dismount, knockback, or damage targets:

<details>

<summary>Mob speed requirements</summary>

<p>A mob using an engaged spear must be moving at the below horizontal speed or faster to dismount enemies:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Tier</td>

</table>

<p>A mob using an engaged or tired spear must be moving horizontally at 0.051 blocks/tick to knockback enemies.</p>

<p>A mob using a spear must be moving horizontally at 0.046 blocks/tick relative to the enemy's horizontal velocity to deal damage.</p>

</details>

Mobs use a spear for half the time a player can use a spear, rounded up to the nearest tick:

| Tier      |  Use Time |
| --------- | ---------:|
| Wood      | 13.40 sec |
| Stone     | 12.25 sec |
| Copper    | 11.10 sec |
| Iron      |  9.45 sec |
| Gold      | 11.75 sec |
| Diamond   |  8.75 sec |
| Netherite |  7.60 sec |

The mob charges at its target until it is less than 2 blocks to its target, or until it finishes pathfinding and cannot reach its target. Then, it retreats to a block 6 to 12.728 blocks away horizontally from the player and starts charging again. The mob keeps charging and retreating until the spear use time runs out.

Once the mob's spear use time runs out, it flees to a block 0 to 19.799 blocks away horizontally from the player, and only then can the mob use the spear again.

<details>

<summary>How the retreat/flee position is selected</summary>

<p>To choose a block to run away to, the mob will try to generate 10 candidate blocks using the below procedure, then pathfind to the block with the lowest pathfinding cost. If the mob cannot find a block, it tries again on the next tick.</p>

<p>First, the mob will look directly opposite from the player horizontally and pick a random angle up to 90 degrees to the left or right. Then, it picks a random radius between a minimum and maximum (with probability proportional to the radius' square root), and rejects any blocks outside a grid-aligned square of a certain size, as shown by the formulas below:</p>

<p>For retreating (or after a failed flee attempt):</p>
$$ \begin{gather}
(6 - \text{distance})\sqrt{2} & \leq & \text{radius} & \leq & (9 - \text{distance})\sqrt{2} \\
-9 & \leq & x,z & \leq & 9
\end{gather} $$

<p>For fleeing:</p>
$$ \begin{gather}
\max(0, 10 - \text{distance})\sqrt{2} & \leq & \text{radius} & \leq & \max(1, 14 - \text{distance})\sqrt{2} \\
-\max(1, 14 - \text{distance}) & \leq & x,z & \leq & \max(1, 14 - \text{distance})
\end{gather} $$

<p>Where <code>distance</code> is the mob's horizontal distance to the player, <code>radius</code> is the randomly chosen radius, and <code>x, z</code> are the X-offset and Z-offset from the mob's position.</p>

<p>Then, the mob picks a random y-offset within -7 and +7 blocks to determine the chosen block. The chosen block must be a full occlusion block and within the build height.</p>

<p>If the chosen block is a solid block, then the mob checks blocks above until it finds a block that is not solid. If that block is water, it is rejected.</p>

</details>

## Structures

### Bastion Remnant

Two items were added to bastion treasure chest loot, in the pool containing diamond gear (3 pulls):

| Item            | Weight |  Chance |
| --------------- | ------ | -------:|
| Diamond Spear\* | 6/112  | 15.258% |
| Diamond Spear   | 6/112  | 15.258% |

\* All enchantments are equally probable, including treasure enchantments (except Soul Speed, Swift Sneak, and Wind Burst), and any level of the enchantment is equally probable. The item has between 80% and 100% of its total durability.

### Buried Treasure

An item was added to buried treasure chest loot, in the pool containing an iron sword and leather tunic (0-1 pulls):

| Item       | Weight |  Chance |
| ---------- | ------ | -------:|
| Iron Spear | 1/3    | 16.667% |

## Zombie Horse

The amount of rotten flesh dropped from zombie horses has increased:

| Count       |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  | Average |
| ----------- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-------:|
| Default     | 1/2 | 1/2 |     |     |     |   2.5   |
| Looting I   | 1/4 | 2/4 | 1/4 |     |     |    3    |
| Looting II  | 1/6 | 2/6 | 2/6 | 1/6 |     |   3.5   |
| Looting III | 1/8 | 2/8 | 2/8 | 2/8 | 1/8 |    4    |

Zombie horses drop 1-3 experience when killed by a player.

### Spawning

Zombie horse jockeys spawn in the following biomes:

| Biome             | Weight | Chance |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Plains            | 5/515  | 0.971% |
| Sunflower Plains  | 5/515  | 0.971% |
| Snowy Plains      | 5/515  | 0.971% |
| Savanna           | 5/515  | 0.971% |
| Savanna Plateau   | 5/515  | 0.971% |
| Windswept Savanna | 5/515  | 0.971% |

Zombie horses spawn with pack size 1.

### Statistics

Zombie horses cannot be bred, but they do spawn with randomized stats with the same distribution as regular horses, although with less variation.

| Stat          |          Mob |  Min   |  Avg   |  Max   |
| ------------- | ------------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| Speed         |        Horse | 0.1125 | 0.2250 | 0.3375 |
| Speed         | Zombie Horse | 0.2135 | 0.2491 | 0.2846 |
| Jump Strength |        Horse |  0.4   |  0.7   |  1.0   |
| Jump Strength | Zombie Horse |  0.5   |  0.6   |  0.7   |

## Advancements

The "Monster Hunter" and "Monsters Hunted" advancements now require both the zombie nautilus and zombie horse.

## Mobs

If a zombie, zombie villager, husk, or zombified piglin spawns with a weapon, the chances it spawns with certain weapons have changed:

| Weapon      | Before | After |
| ----------- | ------:|:----- |
| Iron Shovel |    2/3 | 2/3   |
| Iron Sword  |    1/3 | 1/6   |
| Iron Spear  |    N/A | 1/6   |

All mobs with anger (except the warden) now count down their anger time while unloaded.

### Horse

Feeding a horse a red mushroom heals **3 health** and increases temper by 3, but does not sped up growth.

### Zombie

Zombies riding zombie horses can now drop red mushrooms:

| Count       |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  | Average |
| ----------- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-------:|
| Default     | 1/2 | 1/2 |     |     |     |   0.5   |
| Looting I   | 1/4 | 2/4 | 1/4 |     |     |    1    |
| Looting II  | 1/6 | 2/6 | 2/6 | 1/6 |     |   1.5   |
| Looting III | 1/8 | 2/8 | 2/8 | 2/8 | 1/8 |    2    |

Standalone zombies now spawn less often in certain biomes to make room for zombie horse jockeys:

| Biome             | Old Weight | Old Chance | New Weight | New Chance |

### Drowned

If an adult drowned **with a trident** spawns naturally or from a structure, excluding river biomes, then there is a 50% chance the drowned will spawn riding a zombie nautilus.

### Piglin

If a piglin spawns with a gold sword, there is a **10% chance** it will spawn with a gold spear instead.

### Zombified Piglin

If a zombified piglin spawns with a gold sword, there is a **5% chance** it will spawn with a gold spear instead.

## Blocks

Composters and jukeboxes now always spawn items 0.01 blocks above the block when ejected from them, fixing [MC-271941](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-271941).

## Technical Changes

Teleport commands now reset flying detection, fixing [MC-267364](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-267364).

### `/stopwatch`

Unlike other query commands, `/stopwatch <id> query` only *prints* the elapsed time in chat, the command **always returns 1**.

Stopwatches have millisecond precision, but their resolution (how frequently the stopwatch is updated) depends on the operating system (see Java `System.nanoTime()` [docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/System.html#nanoTime())).

### Tags

Added the `#zombie_horse_food` item tag.

Added the `#exclusive_set/lunge` enchantment tag.

### Enchantments

`exponent` in the changelog is a level-based value that can be used anywhere a level-based value is expected.

Added the `exponential` enchantment value effect component. It multiplies the old value with the base raised to the specified exponent.
- `base` - Level-based value indicating the base of the exponent.
- `exponent` - Level-based value indicating the power of the exponent.

### Debug

Several debug properties were moved to debug renderers on the debug settings screen:

| Debug Property                  | Debug Renderer                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `-DMC_DEBUG_CHUNKS`             | `visualize_chunks_on_server`         |
| `-DMC_DEBUG_COLLISION`          | `visualize_collision_boxes`          |
| `-DMC_DEBUG_SUPPORT_BLOCKS`     | `visualize_entity_supporting_blocks` |
| `-DMC_DEBUG_HEIGHTMAP`          | `visualize_heightmap`                |
| `-DMC_DEBUG_SKY_LIGHT_SECTIONS` | `visualize_sky_light_sections`       |
| `-DMC_DEBUG_SOLID_FACE`         | `visualize_solid_faces`              |
| `-DMC_DEBUG_WATER`              | `visualize_water_levels`             |

Two new debug renderers were added to the debug settings screen: `visualize_block_light_levels` and `visualize_sky_light_levels`. They display the block light of nearby blocks in red to orange, and the sky light of nearby blocks in blue.

![A screenshot showing several red and blue floating numbers](/snapshots/img/25w41a_light_renderer.png)

The `-DMC_DEBUG_LIGHT` debug property was removed. Instead, it renders when either `visualize_block_light_levels` or `visualize_sky_light_levels` is enabled.
