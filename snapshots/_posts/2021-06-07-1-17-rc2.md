The second (and probably final) pre-release is out. The changelog says, "fixed a few critical issues", but now we know what those critical issues are.

# "Critical Issues"

- Blocked loading skins from [education.minecraft.net](education.minecraft.net) and [bugs.mojang.com](bugs.mojang.com)
- Added error handling (crash fix) for dispensing spawn eggs
- Improved error handling (crash fix) for opening the JAR as a resource pack
- Crash fix for placing blocks (podzol) under trees during levelgen

Thanks to `skyrising#1562` in #snapshot-discussion on the [SciCraft Discord](discord.gg/scicraft) for some of this information.
