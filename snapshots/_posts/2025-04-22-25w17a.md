The Locator Bar is no longer experimental. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-25w17a).

## Happy Ghast

Happy Ghasts now avoid the following blocks:
- Sweet Berry Bush
- Cactus
- Wither Rose
- Magma Block
- Fire
- Pointed Dripstone

Tempted Ghastlings now follow players from 3 blocks away instead of 5 blocks away.

## Leash Mechanics

Shearing a leash off an entity now emits a `shear` vibration (frequency 6) instead of a `block_attach` vibration (frequency 10).
