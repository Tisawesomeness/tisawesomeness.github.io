Time to update those custom launchers. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w14a).

## Breeze

When a Breeze reflects a projectile, the projectile's power (acceleration) is reduced to 5% of its original power. The projectile is reflected with 50% of its original speed, rather than 25%.

Player-fired wind charges can no longer be deflect by the Breeze, fixing [MC-268597](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-268597).
