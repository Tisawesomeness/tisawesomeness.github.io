New music, new advancements, and a new light engine! See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-23w17a).

## Music Disc

The Relic music disc was added. It cannot drop from creepers. The music disc generates with a 1/12 chance in rare trail ruins loot:

## Sniffer

Sniffers now follow players holding seeds from 1 block further away, fixing [MC-262030](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-262030).

Sniffer digging now uses the `gameplay/sniffer_digging` loot table.

## Tags

The `#decorated_pot_ingredients` item tag was added. The `#decorated_pot_sherds` item tag no longer contains the brick item.
