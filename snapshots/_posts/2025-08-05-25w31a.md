The Copper Golem! See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-25w31a).

## Copper Chest

Copper chests have **3 hardness** and **2.5 blast resistance**. Note that the blast resistance is the same as regular chests, and different from other copper blocks (6).

Copper chests can be waterlogged.

The correct tool for copper chests is a **stone pickaxe** or stronger. Mining with an incorrect tool will cause the chest's contents to drop, but not the chest itself.

Copper chests weather at the same rate as other copper blocks. If a copper chest is part of a double chest, only the left chest weathers. Copper chests will not weather if they are open.

## Copper Golem

The copper golem is **0.875 blocks wide**, **1 block tall**, and has en eye height of 0.8125. They have **12 max health**, can step up one block, and their movement speed attribute is 0.2.

Copper golems can breathe underwater and are **immune to fall damage**.

Although copper golems visually have a lightning rod, **they do not attract lightning**.

When a copper golem spawns, it waits **3 seconds** before sorting items.

When a player interacts with a copper golem with an empty hand, the golem throws its held item towards the player with the same mechanics as allays and piglins.

When attacked, copper golems panic and run at 1.5× speed for 5-6 seconds.

Copper golems drop **1-3 copper ingots** (1-6 with Looting III) on death with varying chances based on the looting level:

| Count       | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | Avg |
| ----------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| No Looting  | 1/3  | 1/3  | 1/3  |      |      |      | 2   |
| Looting I   | 1/6  | 2/6  | 2/6  | 1/6  |      |      | 2.5 |
| Looting II  | 1/12 | 3/12 | 4/12 | 3/12 | 1/12 |      | 3   |
| Looting III | 1/18 | 3/18 | 5/18 | 5/18 | 3/18 | 1/18 | 3.5 |

### Oxidization

Copper golems spawn with the same oxidization level as the copper block that created it. However, if the copper block is waxed, the copper golem will **not** be waxed.

Copper golems oxidize once every **7 hours to 7 hours 40 minutes**. The golem does not have to be loaded for the timer to count down, but it does have to be loaded for it to oxidize to the next stage.

If a copper golem is fully oxidized when it oxidizes again, it will try to turn into a statue every tick until it succeeds (or is scraped/waxed). A copper golem can turn into a statue if:
- Its position is in an air block
- Its position is within a cylinder with radius 0.15 blocks (exclusive) from the block's middle and height 0.2 blocks (exclusive) above the block's bottom

Note that the copper golem can turn into a statue midair, it does not have to be standing on a block.

When a copper golem freezes into a statue, it freezes into a random pose. No entity data is saved except for its name.

Copper golems do not de-oxidize when struck by lightning.

Waxing or unwaxing a copper golem does **not** grant the "Wax On" and "Wax Off" advancements.

### Chest Searching

The copper golem does **not** know what is inside each chest until it actually visits that chest. It has **no memory** of what was inside each chest.

If the copper golem does not have a target chest, it searches for chests in a **65×17×65 block box** centered on the golem's current block. It searches for only copper chests if it is not holding anything, and only chests or trapped chests if it is holding an item.

The golem compares the distance between its position and each chest block's center (at `(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)`), then picks the closest. If two chests are the exact same distance apart (with `double` precision), then ties are broken by minimum chunk Z coordinate, then minimum chunk X coordinate. If multiple chests are the exact same distance apart and in the same chunk, the golem picks an arbitrary chest.

If the golem can't find a target chest, it forgets its visited chests and will wait 7 seconds before trying again.

Once a chest has been picked, the copper golem marks it as visited, excluding it from search. Only a single chest is marked as visited, though the other side of a double chest is also excluded from search. Note that "visited chests" is a misnomer: a chest is marked as visited **before** the golem actually walks over to it.

If a player makes the copper golem drop its items (or a golem holding nothing is given items with commands), it forgets its target chest, but does **not** forget the chests it has visited. This means that if a copper golem has tried to put an item in 7 chests when a player removes its item, then it will only check up to 3 copper chests before giving up.

If the target chest has been broken, the copper golem will find a new target, though that block position is still marked as visited (so the golem will check one less chest before giving up). If the target chest is part of a double chest, and the other side was broken, the copper golem still sees it as a valid target.

If the copper golem is unloaded, it forgets its target chest, but does **not** forget that it marked the chest as visited. The copper golem will immediately find a new target, effectively skipping the old target.

### Pathfinding

To reach a chest horizontally, the copper golem's hitbox must be less than **0.2 blocks** from the chest's hitbox in both the X and Z axes (chessboard distance).

Copper golems can reach a chest:
- One block higher if it is standing on anything taller than **0.5 blocks tall** (or the golem is midair at the equivalent y-level)
- At the same level always
- One block lower if it is standing on anything shorter than **0.375 blocks tall** (or the golem is midair at the equivalent y-level)

These two copper golems are barely out of reach of the chest:

![Two copper golems next to a chest, one is standing on a slab one block below the chest, the other is standing on a daylight detector one block above the chest](/snapshots/img/25w31a_chest_reach.png)

The copper golem will try to get as close as possible to the target chest before giving up and picking a new target. The golem will walk as close as it can get to the target, and if it still can't reach, then it moves on to the next target.

A copper golem will give up trying to reach a chest and find a new target if:
- The current copper golem's hitbox is less than 0.5 blocks from the chest's hitbox in both the X and Z axes (chessboard distance)
- The copper golem's position is within 0.5 blocks (inclusive) to 2 blocks (exclusive) below the chest

### Queuing

A copper golem will start queuing if:
- Another copper golem is interacting with the target chest
- The current copper golem's hitbox is less than 3 blocks from the chest's hitbox in both the X and Z axes (chessboard distance)
- The target chest is within vertical reach

When a copper golem starts queuing, it stops in place and waits for the other copper golem to finish placing items inside the chest. There is no limit to how many golems can wait for a single chest, or how long a copper golem can wait.

### Item Sorting

When a copper golem reaches its target chest, it opens the chest one tick later, preventing other copper golems from also opening it. **After 3 seconds total**, it tries to pick up items from a copper chest, or place items in a regular chest or trapped chest, then closes the chest and finds a new target chest the next tick.

**Copper golems sort purely based on the *item type***, or its item ID (visible by pressing `F3+H`). Copper golems do not consider enchantments, potion contents, durability, shulker box contents, custom names, or any other data components.

**The copper golem only reads what items are in the chest after the 3 second wait.** If the chest's contents change while the copper golem is looking inside, those changes will affect what the golem can place inside.

If multiple copper golems reach the same chest on the same tick, they can interact with the chest at the same time. The first copper golem that is ticked will read what's in the chest and place an item, the second copper golem will read what's in the chest and place an item, and so on.

Breaking a copper golem's target chest while it is looking inside will prevent the copper golem from picking up or placing items. The copper golem will find a new target, though that block position is still marked as visited.

When a copper golem reaches its target chest, it immediately reads the chest's contents and decides which sound and animation to play. If the chest's contents change afterwards, **the sound and animation may not match what the copper golem actually does**, meaning the subtitle can be incorrect.

| Subtitle                         | Sound            | Animation     |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Copper Golem is placing an item  | `item_drop`      | Places item   |
| Copper Golem can't place an item | `item_no_drop`   | Spins head    |
| Copper Golem is picking up item  | `no_item_get`    | Picks up item |
| Copper Golem can't pick up item  | `no_item_no_get` | Spins head    |

When a copper golem successfully places its last item, it forgets its visited chests, allowing it to check up to 10 copper chests before giving up.

### Entity Data

The `weather_state` integer field stores 0-3 for unoxidized, exposed, weathered, and oxidized respectively.

The `next_weather_age` integer field keeps track of when the next oxidization happens:
- If -2, the copper golem is waxed and will not oxidize.
- If -1 (or any number less than -2), the copper golem will pick a time to oxidize on the next tick.
- Otherwise, `next_weather_age` is the earliest game time in ticks when the next oxidization happens.

The copper golem introduces two new behavior memories:
- Integer `transport_item_cooldown_ticks`: Countdown timer to when the golem will start transporting items again
- List `visited_block_positions`: List of visited chest positions
	- Compound Tag: A block position
		- Int Array `pos`: The block coordinates `[x, y, z]`
		- String `dimension`: The dimension as a namespaced ID

## Copper Golem Statue

Copper golem statues have **3 hardness**. Completely unoxidized statues have **6 blast resistance**, while exposed, weathered, and oxidized statues have **2.5 blast resistance**.

Copper golem statues can be waterlogged. If a copper golem spawns from a waterlogged statue, the water is not removed.

Fully non-oxidized copper golem statues can be mined with **any tool**, while correct tool for exposed, weathered, and oxidized copper golem statues is a **wooden pickaxe** or stronger.

Copper golem statues weather at the same rate as other copper blocks.

Copper golems have four poses: `standing`, `sitting`, `running`, and `star`, with a comparator output of 1-4 respectively.

## Copper Equipment

All copper tools have **5 mining efficiency** and can mine the same blocks as **stone tools**. See the [wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pickaxe#Speed) for a list of block breaking speeds.

| Type    | Attack | Durability |
| ------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Sword   | 5      | 190        |
| Pickaxe | 3      | 190        |
| Axe     | 9      | 190        |
| Shovel  | 3.5    | 190        |
| Hoe     | 1      | 190        |

| Type       | Armor | Durability |
| ---------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Helmet     | 2     | 121        |
| Chestplate | 4     | 176        |
| Leggings   | 3     | 165        |
| Boots      | 1     | 143        |

All copper tools have **13 enchantability**, and all copper armor has **8 enchantability** (see the [wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanting_mechanics#Enchantability) for details).

### Spawning

If a mob spawns with armor, the chances it will have certain armor tiers equipped has changed:

| Tier    | Old     | New      |
| ------- | ------- | -------- |
| Leather | 37.061% | 33.540%  |
| Copper  | N/A     | 47.623%  |
| Gold    | 48.732% | 16.301%  |
| Chain   | 12.896% | 2.373%   |
| Iron    | 1.268%  | 0.1593%  |
| Diamond | 0.0429% | 0.00407% |

## Shelf

All shelves have **2 hardness** and **3 blast resistance**. Their [flammability](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Fire#Flammable_blocks) is the same as bookshelves, having 30 "ignite odds" and 20 "burn odds".

Shelves can be used as fuel in a furnace, burning for 15 seconds, or enough to smelt **1.5 items**.

Shelves can be waterlogged.

### Redstone Interactions

When a shelf is powered, it first connects to as many shelves **to the left** as it can, then it connects to shelves on the right if possible.

![Two in-game screenshots: the top screenshot taken before and the bottom screenshot taken after. In the before picture, five shelves are placed next to each other in a row, the two shelves on either end are powered and connected, and the shelf in the middle is unpowered. The after picture is identical, except the middle shelf is powered, connecting to the two shelves on the left.](/snapshots/img/25w31a_shelf_priority.png)

Comparators will output:
- 1 if there is only an item in the left slot
- 2 if there is only an item in the middle slot
- 4 if there is only an item in the right slot

If multiple slots contain an item, the comparator will output the total, up to a maximum power of 7. This is equivalent to reading a 3-bit binary number backwards, where placed items are 1 bits, and the left slot represents the least significant bit.

![Eight shelves in a row, containing the following items from left-to-right (where 0 represents no item and 1 represents an item): 000, 100, 010, 110, 001, 101, 011, 111; corresponding to signal strengths 0-7 respectively](/snapshots/img/25w31a_shelf_comparator_outputs.png)

**Hoppers and droppers** can place items in shelves in left-to-right order, and hoppers can take items from shelves in left-to-right order.

## Lightning Rods

All lightning rods weather at the same rate as other copper blocks.

## Mobs

The game no longer emits an `entity_mount` vibration (frequency 6) when:
- A player logs in while riding a vehicle
- When an entity riding a vehicle is loaded
- An entity converts to another type of entity while riding a vehicle
- A vehicle teleports across dimensions
- When a jockey spawns

## Debug Screen

Three debug features were not previously available (except through modding):
- `chunk_section_octree`
- `chunk_section_paths`
- `chunk_section_visibility`

## Assets

Removed `textures/misc/white.png`.

## Tags

Added the  `#lightning_rods` and `#wooden_shelves` item and block tags.

## Networking

If the server encounters an exception during the networking phase, the client will be disconnected with the "Unexpected error during configuration" error message.

## GameTest

The default search radius when using the `/test` command to find/run/clear tests was increased from 200 to 250 blocks.

Test structures spawned through the `/test` command will now clear all blocks and entities (except players) inside.

## Command-Line Options

When the launcher starts the game in offline mode, it supplies the new `--offlineDeveloperMode` argument. It disables contacting the auth servers and fetching the profile's keypair.
