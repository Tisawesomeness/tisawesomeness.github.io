This second 1.18 pre-release is out, now with Java 17! See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-18-pre-release-2).

# Java 17

Mojang may choose to stay on Java 17 for a while since it is a LTS (long-time support) version, but for now we'll have to wait and see. If you use [DecompilerMC](https://github.com/hube12/DecompilerMC) to look at the source code, make sure to grab the latest version from the master branch.
