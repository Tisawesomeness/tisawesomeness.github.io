A few more bugfixes. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-pre-release-3).

## Trident

Players can no longer use tridents by right-clicking if the trident has only one use left. Players can still attack with the trident to break it. This returns tridents to their 1.20.6 behavior.
