Another snapshot adding tweaks to the armadillo and technical changes.

## Armadillo

Armadillos are now scared of the last player/mob that attacked the armadillo within the last 5 seconds. Armadillos no longer unroll when hurt.

When an armadillo is rolled up, it takes roughly half of the original damage according to `(damage - 1) / 2`. Half a heart of damage or lower is fully protected and does no damage.

## Breeze

Breezes now also do not retaliate against other breezes.

A breeze's wind charge now uses the new `wind_charge` damage type.

## Commands

The new `/transfer` command has a permission level of 3, meaning it cannot be used in command blocks by default.

## Tags

Added the `#no_anger_from_wind_charge` entity type tag.

## Region File Format

Region files with LZ4 compression use [compression type](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Region_file_format#Payload) 4.
