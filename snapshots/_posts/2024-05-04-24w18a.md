## Mace

Several changes from the latest [Bedrock Preview](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/26354480452109-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-21-0-24) were ported to Java Edition:
- **Reduced base damage by 1**. In Java, the damage was reduced **from 7 to 6**, while in Bedrock the damage was reduced from 6 to 5.
- Durability increased from 250 to **500**.
- Mace smash attack damage now has **fall-off**:
  - First 3 blocks fallen give 4 damage per block
  - Next 5 blocks fallen give 2 damage per block
  - Any further blocks fallen give 1 damage per block
- Reduced density damage per block from 1 per level to **0.5 per level**.
- Breach, Density, Smite, and Bane of Arthopods are all supposed to be incompatible with each other, but this behavior is currently [bugged](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-271404).

The mace's attack speed was reduced **from 1.6 to 0.5**.

## Entities

Projectiles can now only be reflected once. If the projectile hits another breeze, it will instead pass through the breeze. Fixes [MC-268367](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-268367)

If a mob is set on fire for a non-integer number of ticks, then the fire duration is rounded up to the nearest tick.

Arrows, spectral arrows, and tridents now store the weapon ItemStack that fired the projectile in the `weapon` NBT tag.

## Trial Chambers

[Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tisawesomeness/StructureWorlds/main/TrialChamber/TrialChamber24w18a.zip) a world containing every trial chamber structure template.

The TNT trap was removed.

### Vault Loot

The "rare" loot table for Ominous Vaults has changed. **Wind Burst books are about twice as common, but are now always Wind Burst 1 books.**

Note that ominous vaults pull from a common, rare, and unique pool, the table below is only the "rare" pool. Since ominous vaults always pull 1 item from the rare pool, the chances in the table below are also the chances to get that item from an ominous vault.

| Item                   | Weight | Chance  |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Emerald Block          | 6 → 5  | 17.241% |
| Iron Block             | 4      | 13.793% |
| Crossbow\*             | 4      | 13.793% |
| Golden Apple           | 4 → 3  | 10.345% |
| Diamond Axe\*\*        | 3      | 10.345% |
| Diamond Chestplate\*\* | 3      | 10.345% |

### Structure Files

The following structures were added and removed. Modified structure files were omitted from the list since most structure files were modified in some way. Note that `display_1-3.nbt` is shorthand for `display_1.nbt`, `display_2.nbt`, etc.

## Misc

The frosted ice block no longer random ticks. Instead, it cracks by one level every 3-6 seconds until the block thaws.

Tridents with loyalty levels above 127 function identically to Loyalty 127.
