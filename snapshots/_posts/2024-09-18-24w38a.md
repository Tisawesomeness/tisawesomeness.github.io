A much smaller snapshot this time.

## Inventory

When a player drops an item from the creative inventory (not from the survival inventory or from the player's hand), the game increments a counter by 20. The counter decays by 1 every tick. When the counter reaches 1280, the player cannot drop items from the creative inventory until the counter decays below 1280.

Once the threshold is reached, the player is limited to 1 item drop per second. The counter takes 64 seconds to fully decay back to 0.

The counter threshold is 1480 server-side, in case a mod bypasses the client-side threshold.

## Network Protocol

Servers can no longer ask clients to not disconnect when the client encounters an exception while handling a packet. Clients still will not disconnect if sent an unrecognized custom packet.
