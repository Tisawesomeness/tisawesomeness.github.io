Returning to Wednesday releases, this snapshot buffs witch farms and has an... interesting new piston sound.

## Mobs

A witch now rolls 1-3 times pulling from non-redstone items, and 1 time to determine how much redstone it will drop. This means that witches are guaranteed to drop redstone.

When a witch does one of its 1-3 rolls pulling from non-redstone items, each item has a 1/7 chance instead of a 1/8 chance of being selected (except sticks, which have a 2/7 chance instead of a 2/8 chance). As a result, witches now drop 14.286% more non-redstone items on average.

The chances of getting a specific number of redstone dust from a Witch is shown in the table below:

| Level       | 4    | 5    | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9    | 10   | 11   | Average |
| ----------- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| No Looting  | 1/5  | 1/5  | 1/5 | 1/5 | 1/5 |      |      |      | 6       |
| Looting I   | 1/10 | 1/5  | 1/5 | 1/5 | 1/5 | 1/10 |      |      | 6.5     |
| Looting II  | 1/20 | 3/20 | 1/5 | 1/5 | 1/5 | 3/20 | 1/20 |      | 7       |
| Looting III | 1/30 | 1/10 | 1/6 | 1/5 | 1/5 | 1/6  | 1/10 | 1/30 | 7.5     |

In swamps and mangrove swamps, the skeleton spawn rate was reduced from 100 to 50, and the bogged spawn weight was reduced from 50 to 30, fixing [MC-268598](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-268598).

## Misc

If the `doImmediateRespawn` gamerule is true, players with the oozing, infested, or wind charged status effects will activate those effects immediately on death, fixing [MC-269951](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-269951).

The `fraction` enchnatment value provider will return 0 if the denominator is 0, fixing [MC-271716](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-271716).
