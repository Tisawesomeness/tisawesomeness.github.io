The Creaking Heart now supports comparators.

## Creaking Heart

A comparator attached to a Creaking Heart will decrease its signal strength by 1 for every 32/15 blocks (2.133 blocks) the connected Creaking moves away. The distance is from the bottom center of the Creaking Heart to the Creaking's feet.
