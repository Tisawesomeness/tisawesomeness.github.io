Another smaller snapshot with some allay and warden tweaks.

# Allay

Leashed allays will not try to stay close to the leash holder.

Allays no longer check if they can see the player when throwing items or starting pathfinding to the player.

Allays now panic when hit like other animals. The speed multiplier while panicking is 2.5x.

# Warden

The warden's sniffing cooldown changed from 120 ticks (6 seconds) every time to 100 to 200 ticks (5 to 10 seconds), uniform random.

Anger keeps decaying for mobs that switch dimensions or are in unloaded chunks.

# Misc

If a mob dies near a sculk catalyst and doesn't drop any XP, then the catalyst will not spread any sculk.

Ancient city structures now start generating from y=-27.

Mangrove leaves use color `#92c648` in the inventory.

# Tags

New tags were added:
```diff
+ banner_pattern/no_item_required
+ banner_pattern/pattern_item/creeper
+ banner_pattern/pattern_item/flower
+ banner_pattern/pattern_item/globe
+ banner_pattern/pattern_item/mojang
+ banner_pattern/pattern_item/piglin
+ banner_pattern/pattern_item/skull
+ blocks/snow_layer_cannot_survive_on
+ blocks/snow_layer_can_survive_on
+ instrument/goat_horns
+ instrument/regular_goat_horns
+ instrument/screaming_goat_horns
```

`flap` was removed from the `vibrations` and `warden_can_listen` game event tags.
