This massive snapshot adds cherry trees, archaeology, and the Sniffer!

# Blocks

| Block            | Hardness | Blast Resistance |
| ---------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Suspicious Sand  | 0.25     | 0.25             |
| Decorated Pot    | 0        | 0                |
| Pink Petals      | 0.1      | 0.1              |
| Torchflower      | 0        | 0                |
| Torchflower Crop | 0        | 0                |

The cherry wood and leaf blocks have the same hardness and blast resistance values as other wood types.

# Archaeology

Using the brush tool on a block brushes the block once every **half second**. A suspicious sand drops an item after **10 brushes** (5 seconds if continuous). The brush counter will reset after **2 seconds** without brushing.

Suspicious sand without a supporting block generates falling dust particles like normal sand.

## Desert Wells

**2-3 suspicious sand** generate in each well structure. Brushing suspicious sand in desert wells can drop one of the following items:
- Brick
- Emerald
- Stick
- Arms Up Pottery Shard (**3x more likely** as other items)
- Suspicious Stew with one of the following effects and random durations:
	- Night Vision 7-10s
	- Jump Boost 7-10s
	- Weakness 6-8s
	- Blindness 5-7s
	- Poison 10-20s

## Desert Pyramids

**A new secret room was added to desert pyramids!**

The entrance is located at the back of the ground floor. Notice the line of sand on the ground.

Digging out the sand reveals a pathway to the cellar.
![](/snapshots/img/23w07a-pyramid2.png)

The cellar is a 5x3x5 room with a 1x2x1 cutout on each side, all filled with sand. **5-7 blocks** of sand will be suspicious sand (or less if the structure cannot fully generate). The room looks like this after fully excavating:

Brushing suspicious sand in desert pyramids can drop one of the following items:
- Archer Pottery Shard
- Prize Pottery Shard
- Skull Pottery Shard
- Gunpowder
- TNT
- Diamond
- Emerald

The probability of getting a particular number of diamonds (or more) from a fully-generated desert pyramid is:

| Min Diamonds | Probability | Exact         |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1            | 60%         | 494359/823543 |
| 2            | 20.7%       | 170791/823543 |
| 3            | 4.34%       | 35719/823543  |
| 4            | 0.563%      | 4639/823543   |
| 5            | 0.0448%     | 369/823543    |
| 6            | 0.00202%    | 50/2470629    |
| 7            | 0.0000405%  | 1/2470629     |

Note that there is an approximately **40%** chance a pyramid does not contain any diamonds.

# Cherry Grove

Cherry groves have temperature 0.5 and downfall 0.8.

Sheep, rabbits, and donkeys spawn in cherry groves. Cherry groves count as a mountain biome, so emeralds and infested stone will generate.

# Cherry Trees

If there is a flower within a 5x3x5 box centered on the sapling, the grown cherry tree has a **5%** chance to generate with a beehive.

# Pink Petals

Bonemealing pink petals adds 1 flower. If there are already 4 flowers, another flower pops off as an item.

Pink petals have a **30%** chance to fill up a composter by one level.

The best tool for pink petals is the hoe.

# Sniffer

Sniffers have **14 health** (7 hearts) and a movement speed attribute of 0.1. This doubles to 0.2 when in water or panicking, and increases by 25% to 0.125 when sniffing.

| Age   | Width | Height | Length | Eye Height |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| Adult | 1.9   | 1.75   | 1.9    | 1.14       |
| Baby  | 0.95  | 0.875  | 0.95   | 0.525      |

Sniffers have a **10%** chance to drop a single moss block on player-related kill, increasing by 2% for each looting level up to 16% with looting III.

Sniffer babies take **40 minutes** to grow into an adult. Feeding the baby a torchflower seed will grow the baby by 10% of its remaining age to become an adult.

## Sniffing

When sniffing, the sniffer picks a random block in a 21x5x21 box centered on the sniffer, a 25x5x25 box, 29x5x29, 33x5x33, and 37x5x37 (5 blocks total). The sniffer may search closer locations if it is restricted by a leash. If any of the blocks picked can be dug and there is an air block directly above, the sniffer will walk towards that block to dig up torchflower seeds.

Sniffers can dig a block if the block is:
- Dirt
- Grass Block
- Podzol
- Coarse Dirt
- Rooted Dirt
- Moss Block
- Mud
- Muddy Mangrove Roots

## Digging

Once the sniffer reaches the block to dig, it will dig for a random duration from 160-180 ticks (8-9 seconds), then spawn a torchflower seed. If the sniffer digs successfully or is interrupted by taking damage, it sets an **8 minute** cooldown before it can sniff again. When digging finishes, the sniffer waits 2 seconds before resuming normal behvaior.

When the sniffer finishes digging, it saves its current position in its list of explored positions. If there are 21 positions saved, the oldest is removed. Sniffers cannot dig up another torchflower from an already explored position. Destroying and placing the block does not do anything because the sniffer saves the **position**, not the block itself.

# Torchflower

Torchflowers have 3 stages of growth (age) from 0-2. Torchflowers are 1/3 as likely as other crops to increase their growth stage when random ticked (given same conditions).

Bonemealing a torchflower has a **1/4 chance to fail**.

Torchflowers have a **85%** chance to fill up a composter by one level, and torchflower seeds have a **30%** chance.

Crafting a suspicious stew with a torchflower (not currently possible due to a [bug](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-260033)) gives **night vision** for 5 seconds.

# Horse Breeding

The horse breeding fomulas were changed to the proposed fix in the comments of [MC-16533](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-16533). See [this website](https://www.matthewgatland.com/horses_old_and_new.html) for an interactive comparison (thanks to [Matthew Gatland](https://www.matthewgatland.com/)).

# Particles

Three new particle types were added:
```
dripping_cherry_leaves
falling_cherry_leaves
landing_cherry_leaves
```

# Tags

Added two new block tags:
```
cherry_logs
sniffer_diggable_blocks
```

Added 10 new item tags:
```
cherry_logs
decorated_pot_shards
sniffer_food
axes
breaks_decorated_pots
hoes
pickaxes
shovels
swords
tools
```

Note that the `#tools` tag contains swords and tridents.

# Sounds

An unused `music.overworld.cherry_grove` sound is mentioned in the game's code.

A new `minecraft:intentionally_empty` sound was added.

# Moderation

When a player is banned, one of the following reasons will display:
- Impersonation or sharing information to exploit or mislead others
- References to illegal drugs
- Depictions of real-life excessive violence or gore
- Excessive false or inaccurate reports
- Fraudulent acquisition or use of content
- Violating Community Standards
- Abusive language used in a directed, harmful manner
- Hate speech or discrimination
- References to hate groups, terrorist organizations, or notorious figures
- Intent to cause real-life harm to persons or property
- Displaying lewd or pornographic material
- Topics or content of a sexual nature
- Spam or advertising

The reasons used to report other players are **unchanged**, and not all ban reasons have corresponding report reasons (example: "Spam or advertising" is a ban reason but not a report reason).

# Misc

Players can no longer be kicked for flying while dead or dying, fixing [MC-258580](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-258580).

# Edits
