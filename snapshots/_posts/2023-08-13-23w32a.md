This snapshot brings vibration changes and many technical changes.

## Chat

Clients will still disconnect themselves when receiving a player chat message in the following cases:

- The client has not seen the chat message author's UUID
- The server sends an invalid chat type
- The client fails to verify the "last seen" signatures of a message due to previously cached null signatures
