A new snapshot adds a new way to deal absurd damage. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w11a).

## The Mace

The mace has **250** durability (same as iron sword), does **7 damage** and has 1.6 attack speed (same as diamond sword). Like a sword, it can destroy cobwebs 15x faster, but does not mine blocks in the `#sword_efficient` tag any faster. Creative players cannot break blocks while holding the mace.

When the player hits an entity after falling more than **1.5 blocks**, the damage dealt is multiplied by $$(1 + 0.5 \cdot \text{fallDistance})$$. Assuming a crit, the mace does $$(10.5 + 5.25 \cdot \text{fallDistance})$$ damage. Mobs within **2.5 blocks** of the player are knocked back. Mobs closer to the player are knocked back with more force, but all entities within the area of effect are knocked upwards with the same velocity. Knockback resistance reduces the knockback.

Hitting an entity with the mace only resets all fall damage at the player's current height. If the player falls further, they will take damage as if they fell from the height they used the mace.

Only players can use the bonus damage of the mace.

## Heavy Core

The heavy core has **30 hardness**, **30 blast resistance**, and no assigned tool. It takes **45 seconds** to mine.

The heavy core has the same shape as a player head, and can be placed in the same 12 orientations as the crafter (however, the texture of each side is identical so there is no visual difference).

## Breeze

The chances of getting a specific number of breeze rods from the Breeze is shown in the table below:

| Count       | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | Average |
| ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- |
| Default     | 1/2 | 1/2 |     |     |     |     |     |     | 1.5     |
| Looting I   |     | 1/4 | 1/2 | 1/4 |     |     |     |     | 3       |
| Looting II  |     |     | 1/6 | 1/3 | 1/3 | 1/6 |     |     | 4.5     |
| Looting III |     |     |     | 1/8 | 1/4 | 1/4 | 1/4 | 1/8 | 6       |

## Trial Chambers

[Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tisawesomeness/StructureWorlds/main/TrialChamber/TrialChamber24w11a.zip) a world containing every trial chamber structure template.

Trial spawners are now 76% more common.

Decorated pots in trial chambers now have a 1/13 chance to have a flow sherd, a 1/13 to have a guster sherd, and a 1/13 chance to have a scrape sherd. All pots use the same loot table regardless of sherds.

### Loot

The `chests/trial_chambers/reward` loot table for trial chamber vaults now pulls from `reward_common`, `reward_rare`, and `reward_unique` loot tables.

Vaults now pull from 3 pools:
- 1 roll, with an 80% chance to pull from rare loot and a 20% chance to pull from common loot
- 1-3 rolls pulling from common loot
- A 25% chance to do 1 roll pulling from unique loot

The chances in the below tables are the chances for getting any of the given item from a **vault**, not the chance of getting the item from the loot table.

#### Common Loot

| Iron Ingot          | 1-4   | 3      | 31.588% |
| Honey Bottle        | 1-2   | 3      | 31.588% |
| Wind Charge         | 1-12  | 1      | 11.414% |

### Structures

The following structures were added:

```
pedestal/
  center_1.nbt
  quadrant_1-4.nbt
  slice_1-5.nbt
slanted/
  center.nbt
  hallway_1-5.nbt
  quadrant_1-4.nbt
  ramp_1-4.nbt
decor/
  flow_pot.nbt
  guster_pot.nbt
  scrape_pot.nbt
```

`chests/supply.nbt` and `reward/default.nbt` were modified to change the block layouts around chests and vaults. `dispensers/chamber.nbt` was modified to change an oak button with a stone button.

## UI

The Menu Background Blur setting now controls the blur's radius, not its transparency.

When the Menu Background Blur setting is less than 10%, the blur shader is completely disabled, fixing [MC-269032](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-269032).

## Misc

`/datapack` will now give an error when trying to unload a datapack that is required by the world's feature flags.

The unused shaders that were leftover from Super Secret Settings were removed.
