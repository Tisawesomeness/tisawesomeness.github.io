This snapshot improves cartographer and wandering trader trades. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-25w07a).

## Entities

### Camel

Camels can spawn on sand and red sand (the `#sand` tag) by default. Passive mobs that spawn during desert generation have a 12/13 chance to be a rabbit and 1/13 chance to be a camel.

### Sheep

Sheep have updated rules for which color of wool they have based on which biome they spawn in:

| Cold       | Temperate  | Warm   | Chance  |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------ | ------- |
| Black      | White      | Brown  | 81.836% |
| Light Gray | Black      | Gray   | 5%      |
| Light Blue | Gray       | Yellow | 5%      |
| Blue       | Light Gray | Orange | 5%      |
| Cyan       | Brown      | Red    | 3%      |
| Pink       | Pink       | Pink   | 0.164%  |

Which biomes are "cold", "temperate", or "warm" are the same as other farm animals, such as pigs.

## Trading

### Cartographer

Some Cartographer trades have changed:

| Item Wanted          | Item Given           | XP  | Trades until Disabled |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | --- | --------------------- |
| 24 Paper             | Emerald              | 2   | 16 →  12              |
| 11 Glass Panes       | Emerald              | 10  | 16 →  12              |
| 3 →  2 Emeralds      | Banner\*             | 15  | 12                    |
| 14 Emeralds, Compass | Woodland Mansion Map | 30  | 1 →  12               |

\* The possible banner colors now depends on the village type.

### Wandering Trader

Wandering Trader trades are the same as the Trade Rebalance experiment, but with five new trades added:

| Item Wanted | Item Given      | XP  | Trades until Disabled |
| ----------- | --------------- | --- | --------------------- |
| Emerald     | 8 Mangrove Logs | 1   | 4                     |
| Emerald     | 8 Pale Oak Logs | 1   | 4                     |
| Emerald     | Wildflowers     | 1   | 12                    |
| Emerald     | Dry Tall Grass  | 1   | 12                    |
| 3 Emeralds  | Firefly Bush    | 1   | 12                    |

## Structures

Bundles have a 1/3 chance to spawn in plains, desert, savanna, snowy, and taiga village house chests, as well as cartographer, tannery, and weaponsmith house chests. The bundle is in its own pool in the loot table and does not affect the chances of any other item.
