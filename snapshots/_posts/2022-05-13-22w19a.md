A new snapshot with lots of technical changes.

# Warden

When spawning a warden or iron golem, the game will spawn them on blocks with collision and a full top face, and the blocks above that the mob spawns in must have no collision.

The warden will increase its anger by 20 when roaring at a mob.

# Sculk Shrieker

The shrieker now has a warning level from 0 to 4 instead of 0 to 3 to accommodate the unused sound mentioned in [MC-249910](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-249910).

A sculk shrieker will not activate if **any** players within shrieker range are on the shrieker cooldown.

# Tadpoles

Tadpoles stranded on land will no longer try to find water.

# Movement

Players will only stay on a block while crouching if they are moving downwards or not moving vertically, fixing [MC-197647](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-197647).
