An overhaul to item models making many new features possible.

## Mobs

If two cats or two wolves have compatible collar colors (meaning one dye from one parent and one dye from another parent can be crafted into a third dye), the resulting baby inherits a mix of their colors (according to the output of the crafting recipe). This uses the same mechanics as sheep breeding.

The "Mobs picking up items" section in the changelog lists criteria in order of priority (for example, mobs will compare armor values before comparing toughness values).

## Eyeblossoms

Eyeblossoms emit a `block_change` (frequency 11) vibration when they open or close.

## Structures

Resin Clumps were removed from woodland mansion chests.

The game draws items 1-4 times from the pool containing resin.

| Item        | Count | Weight | Chance\* | Avg Per Chest |
| ----------- | ----- | ------ | -------- | ------------- |
| Resin Brick | 1-2   | 50/125 | 53.769%  | 1.714         |

\* Chance is the odds of finding at least one of this item in a single chest

Resin Clumps were removed from the pool containing the below items, making them somewhat more common to obtain:
- Wheat
- Bread
- Coal
- Redstone Dust
- Beetroot Seeds
- Melon Seeds
- Pumpkin Seeds
- Iron Ingot
- Bucket
- Gold Ingot
