Another snapshot for 1.18.2 is out with many hidden changes.

# Powder Snow

Goats and wolves now try to avoid powder snow.

If a mob that can walk on top of powder snow is stuck inside a powder snow block, the mob will try to jump out every tick.

# Parrot bug fix

Parrots will dismount from the player when the player uses a trident with riptide.

# Superflat

The water world preset was changed to `minecraft:bedrock,64*minecraft:deepslate,5*minecraft:stone,5*minecraft:dirt,5*minecraft:gravel,90*minecraft:water;minecraft:deep_ocean` as suggested in the [bug report](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-239708)

# South Korea

Minecraft shows the required gaming notices if the **computer's** default locale is `KOR`.

# Usernames

Servers will now try to verify that player usernames on valid. Valid usernames only contain ASCII characters 33 to 126, which includes all ASCII letters, numbers, and keyboard-reachable special characters. Spaces are NOT allowed.

# Tag Changes

Tags are now defined for all registries, which also means those registries can be reoloaded while the server is still running.
