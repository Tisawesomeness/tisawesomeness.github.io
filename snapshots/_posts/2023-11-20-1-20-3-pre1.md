The first pre-release for 1.20.3 is out, adding tools for server resource packs and bugfixes.

## Breeze

The breeze no longer needs to be on the ground to shoot.

If the breeze meets all of the following conditions:

- Either:
  - It is a passenger of another entity, such as a boat or minecart
  - It is in water
  - It has the levitation effect
- It is not currently shooting, long jumping, or sliding
- It has not finished a long jump within the past 5 seconds or a slide within the past 3 seconds

Then the breeze can then shoot at any time within the next 3 seconds, as soon as the following conditions are met:

- It has an attack target
- The target is between **2-16** blocks away
- Shooting is not on cooldown (10 ticks)

After the breeze shoots or the 3 seconds are over, the above conditions (including passenger/water/levitation) can be checked again, and the breeze may shoot again within the next 3 seconds. This means the breeze can shoot twice in a row.

These changes fix [MC-266468](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-266468), [MC-266456](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-266456), and [MC-266571](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-266571).

## Tags

Added the `#can_turn_in_boats` entity type tag, containing only the breeze, fixing [MC-266456](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-266456).

## Resource Packs

If `resource-pack-id` is missing from `server.properties`, the server will generate a [version 3 UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Versions_3_and_5_(namespace_name-based)) based on the `resource-pack` URL as a UTF-8 string:

```java
UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes(url.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```

The resource pack ID for the Realms pack is `08c3b151-90fb-4c09-b6cf-0548364671bb`, and ID for the world pack (`resources.zip`) is `640a6a92-b6cb-48a0-b391-831586500359`.
