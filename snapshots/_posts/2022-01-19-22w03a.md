The first snapshot of 2022 is here.

# Seed Changes

Entering "0" as the world seed will now actually create a world with seed 0.

Seeds are trimmed using Java's [String#trim](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#trim()), which deletes all spaces (characters with codepoint less than `U+0020`) at the start and end of the seed. Unicode whitespace will not be removed.

# Tag Changes

Added the `#fall_damage_resetting` tag.

Removed powder snow from the `#goat_spawnable_on` block tag to prevent goats from spawning on powder snow ([MC-241152](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-241152)).

Added snow block and powder snow to the `#azalea_root_replaceable` block tag so that rooted dirt from azalea trees can replace those blocks ([MC-242010](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-242010)).

# Logging

Mojang switched from Log4J to SLF4J. Good choice.
