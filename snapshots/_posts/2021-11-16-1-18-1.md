1.18.1 is now out. See the [changelog](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-18-1).

# Details

There are no changes from 1.18.1-rc3. Mojang has released an [official announcement](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-message--security-vulnerability-java-edition) on the fixed security vulnerability. It is highly recommended that you read the announcement, especially if you run a server, use a custom client, or play on any old version.
