Another 1.19 pre-release is out.

# Warden

When the warden starts digging, it will force unmount off of any entity it is riding.

The warden can listen to the new `teleport` game event.

# Teleport Game Event

The game will send the `teleport` game event from the **destination** of an enderman, shulker, or chorus fruit teleport. Players do **not** send the teleport game event when using an ender pearl, though any sensors nearby would detect the `projectile_land` game event first anyway. Players do **not** send the teleport game event when using a teleport command.

# Tags

A new tag, `worldgen/biome/mineshaft_blocking`, was added that determines which bimoes block mineshafts from generating. It only contains the deep dark by default.
